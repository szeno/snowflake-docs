## Version 3.0.0 (October 1, 2024)

### BCR (Behavior Change Release) changes

Beginning with version 3.0.0, Snowflake CLI introduced the following breaking changes:

- Implemented the following Python changes:

  - Dropped support for Python versions below 3.10.
  - Set the default Python version for Snowpark functions and procedures to 3.10.
- Replaced the `snow object stage` commands with `snow stage` commands.
- Replaced the `snow snowpark init` and `snow streamlit init` commands with the `snow init` command.
- Removed previously deprecated options from the `snow snowpark` commands.
- Modified the behavior of the following Snowpark commands:

  - The `snow snowpark build` creates a `.zip` file for each specified artifact that is a directory. Non-Anaconda dependencies are packaged once as `dependencies.zip`.
  - The `snow snowpark deploy` uploads all artifacts created during build step. The `dependencies.zip` file is uploaded once to every Snowpark stage specified in the project definition.
  - The `snow snowpark package` commands no longer fallback to Anaconda Channel metadata when fetching available packages information fails.

    Note

    These changes are compatible with V1 project definition files, though the resulting file layout differs.

### New features and updates

- Added the following commands:

  - `snow spcs service execute-job` to support creating and executing a job service in the current schema.
  - `snow app events` to fetch logs and traces from local and customer Snowflake Native App installations.
  - `snow helpers v1-to-v2` to migrate snowflake.yml files from version 1.x to version 2.
- Added support for the following:

  - External access (API integrations and secrets) in Streamlit
  - <% … %> syntax in SQL templates
  - Multiple Streamlit applications in a single `snowflake.yml` project definition file
- Updated the project definition file to version 2.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue with whitespace in the `snow connection add` command.
- Fixed a SQL error that occurred when running the `snow app version create` or `snow app version drop` commands with a version name that isn’t a valid Snowflake unquoted identifier.
- Added a check to verify the correctness of a token file and private key paths when adding a connection.
- Fixed a typo in the `spcs service name` argument description. It is the identifier of the `service` instead of the `service pool`.
- Fixed an issue with error handling and improved messaging when no artifacts are provided.
- Improved error messages for incompatible parameters.

## Version 2.8.1 (September 10, 2024)

### New features and updates

- Added the `snow object create` command.
- Added support for a `title` field in Streamlit definition in the `snowflake.yml` project file.
- Added the `--auto-compress` flag to the `snow stage copy` command to enable gzip compression of files during upload.
- Added a new `native_app.application.post_deploy` section to `snowflake.yml` schema to execute actions after the application has been deployed via `snow app run`.

  - Added the `sql_script` hook type to run SQL scripts with template support.
- Added support for `--env` command-line arguments for templating.

  - Available for commands that use the project definition file.
  - Format of the argument: `--env key1=value1 --env key2=value2`.
  - Overrides environment variables values when used in templating.
  - Can be referenced in templating through `ctx.env.<key_name>`.

## Version 2.5.0 (June 20, 2024)

### New features and updates

- Added the following Snowflake Native App features:

  - Added the `snow app bundle` command that prepares a local folder in the project directory with artifacts to upload to a stage as part of creating a Snowflake Native App.

    Snowflake Native App projects can optionally generate CREATE FUNCTION and CREATE PROCEDURE declarations in setup scripts from Snowpark Python code that includes decorators (such as `@sproc` and `@udf`).
  - Added the `snow app validate` command that validates the SQL in the setup script of a Snowflake Native App for valid syntax, invalid object references, and best practices.

    - Added the new `native_app.scratch_stage` field to the `snowflake.yml` schema to allow customizing the stage that Snowflake CLI uses to run the validation.
  - Changed the `snow app deploy` and `snow app run` commands to trigger automatic validation of the setup script SQL and to stop uploads if validation fails. Users can override this check by enabling the `--no-validate` parameter for the respective commands.
  - Changed the `snow app version create --patch` command to require an integer patch number, aligning with what Snowflake expects.

## Version 2.2.0 (April 25, 2024)

### Deprecated features

Note

The following features are deprecated in this version and will be removed when Snowflake releases Snowflake CLI 3.0.0. Please consider updating any existing scripts that use these deprecated features.

- The `snow snowpark package lookup` command no longer performs a check against PyPi. Using `--pypi-download` or `--yes` has no effect and causes a warning. The command now only checks whether a package is available in the Snowflake Anaconda channel.
- `snow snowpark package create` changes:

  - The `--pypi-download` or `--yes` options are deprecated, have no effect, and cause a warning. The command now always checks against PyPi.
  - The `--allow-native-libraries` option is deprecated in favor of the Boolean `--allow-shared-libraries` option. Using the deprecated option causes a warning.
- `snow snowpark build` changes:

  - The `--pypi-download` option is deprecated, has no effect, and causes a warning. The command now always checks against PyPi.
  - The `--check-anaconda-for-pypi-depts` option is deprecated and causes a warning. Use the `--ignore-anaconda` option instead.
  - The `--package-native-libraries` option is deprecated and causes a warning. Use the `--allow-shared-libraries` option instead.
- The `snow object stage` commands are deprecated and cause a warning. These commands are replaced with `snow stage` commands. Please consider migrating any existing scripts that use the `snow object stage` commands.

### New features and updates

- Added support for fully qualified names (`database.schema.name`) in the Streamlit project definition `name` parameter.
- Added support for fully qualified image repository names in `spcs image-repository` commands.
- Added the `--if-not-exists` option to the `snow spcs service create` and `snow spcs compute-pool create` commands.
- Added the `--replace` and `--if-not-exists` options for the `snow spcs image-repository create` command.
- Added support for Snowflake Connector for Python diagnostic reports.
- Added the `snow app deploy` command that creates an application package and syncs the local changes to the stage without creating or updating the application.
- Added the `is_default` column to the `snow connection list` output to highlight the default connection.
- Updated the `snow snowpark package create` command:

  - Added the `--ignore-anaconda` option to disable package lookup in the Snowflake Anaconda channel, so dependencies are downloaded from PyPi.
  - Added the `--skip-version-check` option to skip comparing versions of dependencies between requirements and Anaconda.
  - Added the `--index-url` option to set the base URL of the Python Package Index to use for package lookup.
- Updated the `snow snowpark build` command:

  - Added the `--skip-version-check` option to skip comparing versions of dependencies between requirements and Anaconda.
  - Added the `--index-url` option set up the base URL of the Python Package Index to use for package lookup.
- Added the `--recursive` option to the `snow stage copy` command to reproduce the directory structure locally when copying from a stage.
- Added the following `snow git` commands to support for Git repositories in Snowflake:

  - `snow git setup`: Sets up a Git repository stage and creates all necessary objects.
  - `snow git fetch`: Fetches latest changes from the origin repository into a Snowflake repository.
  - `snow git list-branches`: Lists all branches in a repository.
  - `snow git list-tags`: Lists all tags in a repository.
  - `snow git list-files`: Lists all files on a specified branch, tag, or commit.
  - `snow git copy`: Copies files from a specified branch, tag, or commit into a stage or local directory.

- Added the `--pattern` option to the `snow stage list-files` command to support filtering results with regex.
- Added support for any source supported by `pip` in `snow snowpark` commands.
- Added the ability to fetch available packages list from Snowflake instead of directly from Anaconda with fallback to the old method (for backward compatibility). As the new approach requires a connection to Snowflake, it adds connection options to the following commands:

  - `snow snowpark build`
  - `snow snowpark package lookup`
  - `snow snowpark package create`

### Bug fixes

- Added the `--image-name` option for the image name argument in the `spcs image-repository list-tags` command for consistency with other commands.
- Fixed an issue where `spcs image-registry login` errors were not formatted correctly.
