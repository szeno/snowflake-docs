Warning

As Python 3.8 has reached its [End of Life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/), deprecation warnings will be triggered when using snowpark-python with Python 3.8. For more details, see [Snowflake Python Runtime Support](/developer-guide/python-runtime-support-policy). Snowpark Python 1.24.0 will be the last client and server version to support Python 3.8, in accordance with [Anaconda’s policy](https://forum.anaconda.com/t/python-3-8-reaches-end-of-life/87265). Upgrade your existing Python 3.8 objects to Python 3.9 or greater.

## Version 1.26.0 (2024-12-05)

### New features

- Added support for property `version` and class method `get_active_session` for `Session` class.
- Added new methods and variables to enhance data type handling and JSON serialization/deserialization:

  - To `DataType`, its derived classes, and `StructField`:

    - `type_name`: Returns the type name of the data.
    - `simple_string`: Provides a simple string representation of the data.
    - `json_value`: Returns the data as a JSON-compatible value.
    - `json`: Converts the data to a JSON string.
  - To `ArrayType`, `MapType`, `StructField`, `PandasSeriesType`, `PandasDataFrameType` and `StructType`:

    - `from_json`: Enables these types to be created from JSON data.
  - To `MapType`:

    - `keyType`: keys of the map
    - `valueType`: values of the map
- Added support for method `appName` in `SessionBuilder`.
- Added support for `include_nulls` argument in `DataFrame.unpivot`.
- Added support for following functions in `functions.py`:

  - `size` to get size of array, object, or map columns.
  - `collect_list` an alias of `array_agg`.
  - `concat_ws_ignore_nulls` to concatenate strings with a separator, ignoring null values.
  - `substring` makes `len` argument optional.
- Added parameter `ast_enabled` to session for internal usage (default: `False`).

### Improvements

- Added support for specifying the following to `DataFrame.create_or_replace_dynamic_table`:

  - `iceberg_config` A dictionary that can hold the following iceberg configuration options:
    - `external_volume`
    - `catalog`
    - `base_location`
    - `catalog_sync`
    - `storage_serialization_policy`
- Added support for nested data types to `DataFrame.print_schema`

  - Added `load` method to `DataFrameReader` to work in conjunction with `format`.
  - Added `save` method to `DataFrameWriter` to work in conjunction with `format`.
  - Added support to read keyword arguments to `options` method for `DataFrameReader` and `DataFrameWriter`.
- Relaxed the cloudpickle dependency for Python 3.11 to simplify build requirements. However, for Python 3.11, `cloudpickle==2.2.1` remains the only supported version.

### Bug fixes

- Removed warnings that dynamic pivot features were in private preview, because
  dynamic pivot is now generally available.
- Fixed a bug in `session.read.options` where `False` Boolean values were incorrectly parsed as `True` in the generated file format.

### Dependency updates

## Version 1.25.0 (2024-11-13)

### New features

- Added the following new functions in `snowflake.snowpark.dataframe`:
  - `map`

### Improvements

- When target stage is not set in profiler, a default stage from `Session.get_session_stage` is used instead of raising `SnowparkSQLException`.
- Allowed lower case or mixed case input when calling `Session.stored_procedure_profiler.set_active_profiler`.
- Added distributed tracing using open telemetry APIs for action function in `DataFrame`:

  - `cache_result`
- Removed opentelemetry warning from logging.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the pre-action and post-action query propagation when `In` expressions were used in selects.
- Fixed a bug that raised error `AttributeError` while calling `Session.stored_procedure_profiler.get_output` when `Session.stored_procedure_profiler` is disabled.

### Dependency updates

- Added a dependency on `protobuf>=5.28` and `tzlocal` at runtime.
- Added a dependency on `protoc-wheel-0` for the development profile.
- Require `snowflake-connector-python>=3.12.0, <4.0.0` (was `>=3.10.0`).

### Snowpark pandas API updates

#### New features

- Added support for `Index.to_numpy`.
- Added support for `DataFrame.align` and `Series.align` for `axis=0`.
- Added support for `snowflake.snowpark.functions.window`
- Added support for `pd.read_pickle` (Uses native pandas for processing).
- Added support for `pd.read_html` (Uses native pandas for processing).
- Added support for `pd.read_xml` (Uses native pandas for processing).
- Added support for aggregation functions `"size"` and `len` in `GroupBy.aggregate`, `DataFrame.aggregate`, and `Series.aggregate`.
- Added support for list values in `Series.str.len`.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where aggregating a single-column dataframe with a single callable function (e.g. `pd.DataFrame([0]).agg(np.mean)`) would fail to transpose the result.
- Fixed bugs where `DataFrame.dropna()` would:

  - Treat an empty `subset` (e.g. `[]`) as if it specified all columns instead of no columns.
  - Raise a `TypeError` for a scalar `subset` instead of filtering on just that column.
  - Raise a `ValueError` for a `subset` of type `pandas.Index` instead of filtering on the columns in the index.
- Creation of scoped read-only tables to mitigate `TableNotFoundError` when using dynamic pivot in a notebook environment.
- Fixed a bug when concat dataframe or series objects are coming from the same dataframe when axis = 1.

#### Improvements

- Improve `np.where` with scalar x value by eliminating unnecessary join and temp table creation.
- Improve `get_dummies` performance by flattening the pivot with join.

### Snowpark local testing updates

#### New features

- Added support for patching functions that are unavailable in the `snowflake.snowpark.functions` module.

- Fixed a bug where column aliases were incorrectly resolved in `DataFrame.join`, causing errors when selecting columns from a joined DataFrame.
- Fixed a bug where `Table.update` and `Table.merge` could fail if the target table’s index was not the default `RangeIndex`.

## Version 1.24.0 (2024-10-28)

### New features

- Updated `Session` class to be thread-safe. This allows concurrent DataFrame transformations, DataFrame actions, UDF and stored procedure registration, and concurrent file uploads when using the same `Session` object.

  - The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting `FEATURE_THREAD_SAFE_PYTHON_SESSION` to `True` for account.
  - Updating session configurations, like changing database or schema, when multiple threads are using the session may lead to unexpected behavior.
  - When enabled, some internally created temporary table names returned from `DataFrame.queries` API are not deterministic, and may be different when DataFrame actions are executed. This does not affect explicit user-created temporary tables.
- Added support for ‘Service’ domain to `session.lineage.trace` API.
- Added support for the following methods in `DataFrameWriter` to support daisy-chaining:

  - `option`
  - `options`
  - `partition_by`
- Added support for `snowflake_cortex_summarize`.

### Improvements

- Improved the following new capability for function `snowflake.snowpark.functions.array_remove` so that it is now possible to use in python.
- Disables SQL simplification when sort is performed after limit.
  - Previously, `df.sort().limit()` and `df.limit().sort()` generated the same query with sort in front of limit. Now, `df.limit().sort()` generates a query that reads `df.limit().sort()`.
  - Improve performance of generated queries for `df.limit().sort()` because limit stops table scanning as soon as the number of records is satisfied.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where the automatic cleanup of temporary tables could interfere with the results of async query execution.
- Fixed a bug in `DataFrame.analytics.time_series_agg` function to handle multiple data points in same sliding interval.
- Fixed a bug that created inconsistent casing in field names of structured objects in iceberg schemas.

### Deprecations

- As Python 3.8 has reached its [End of Life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/), deprecation warnings will be triggered when using snowpark-python with Python 3.8. For more details, see [Snowflake Python Runtime Support](/developer-guide/python-runtime-support-policy).
- Snowpark 1.24.0 is the last client and server version to support Python 3.8, in accordance with [Anaconda’s policy](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/python-3-8-reaches-end-of-life). Upgrade your existing Python 3.8 objects to Python 3.9 or greater.

### Snowpark pandas API updates

#### New features

- Added support for `np.subtract`, `np.multiply`, `np.divide`, and `np.true_divide`.
- Added support for tracking usages of `__array_ufunc__`.
- Added numpy compatibility support for `np.float_power`, `np.mod`, `np.remainder`, `np.greater`, `np.greater_equal`, `np.less`, `np.less_equal`, `np.not_equal`, and `np.equal`.
- Added numpy compatibility support for `np.log`, `np.log2`, and `np.log10`
- Added support for `DataFrameGroupBy.bfill`, `SeriesGroupBy.bfill`, `DataFrameGroupBy.ffill`, and `SeriesGroupBy.ffill`.

- Added support for applying Snowpark Python function `snowflake_cortex_summarize`.
- Added support for `DataFrame.attrs` and `Series.attrs`.
- Added support for `DataFrame.style`.
- Added numpy compatibility support for `np.full_like`

#### Improvements

- Improved generated SQL query for `head` and `iloc` when the row key is a slice.
- Improved error message when passing an unknown timezone to `tz_convert` and `tz_localize` in `Series`, `DataFrame`, `Series.dt`, and `DatetimeIndex`.
- Improved documentation for `tz_convert` and `tz_localize` in `Series`, `DataFrame`, `Series.dt`, and `DatetimeIndex` to specify the supported timezone formats.
- Added additional kwargs support for `df.apply` and `series.apply` ( as well as `map` and `applymap` ) when using snowpark functions. This allows for some position independent compatibility between apply and functions where the first argument is not a pandas object.
- Improved generated SQL query for `iloc` and `iat` when the row key is a scalar.
- Removed all joins in `iterrows`.
- Improved documentation for `Series.map` to reflect the unsupported features.
- Added support for `np.may_share_memory` which is used internally by many scikit-learn functions. This method will always return false when called with a Snowpark pandas object.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where `DataFrame` and `Series` `pct_change()` would raise `TypeError` when input contained timedelta columns.
- Fixed a bug where `replace()` would sometimes propagate `Timedelta` types incorrectly through `replace()`. Instead raise `NotImplementedError` for `replace()` on `Timedelta`.
- Fixed a bug where `DataFrame` and `Series` `round()` would raise `AssertionError` for `Timedelta` columns. Instead raise `NotImplementedError` for `round()` on `Timedelta`.
- Fixed a bug where `reindex` fails when the new index is a Series with non-overlapping types from the original index.
- Fixed a bug where calling `__getitem__` on a DataFrameGroupBy object always returned a DataFrameGroupBy object if `as_index=False`.
- Fixed a bug where inserting timedelta values into an existing column would silently convert the values to integers instead of raising `NotImplementedError`.
- Fixed a bug where `DataFrame.shift()` on axis=0 and axis=1 would fail to propagate timedelta types.
- `DataFrame.abs()`, `DataFrame.__neg__()`, `DataFrame.stack()`, and `DataFrame.unstack()` now raise `NotImplementedError` for timedelta inputs instead of failing to propagate timedelta types.

### Snowpark local testing updates

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where `DataFrame.alias` raises `KeyError` for input column name.
- Fixed a bug where `to_csv` on Snowflake stage fails when data contains empty strings.

#### Improvements

- Improved concat and join performance when operations are performed on a series coming from the same DataFrame by avoiding unnecessary joins.
- Refactored `quoted_identifier_to_snowflake_type` to avoid making metadata queries if the types have been cached locally.
- Improved `pd.to_datetime` to handle all local input cases.
- Create a lazy index from another lazy index without pulling data to client.
- Raised `NotImplementedError` for Index bitwise operators.
- Display a more clear error message when `Index.names` is set to a non-list-like object.

- Improved performance for `DataFrame.set_index`, or setting `DataFrame.index` or `Series.index` by avoiding checks that
  require eager evaluation. As a consequence, when the new index that does not match the current `Series` or `DataFrame` object
  length, a `ValueError` is no longer raised. Instead, when the `Series` or `DataFrame` object is longer than the provided
  index, the new index of the `Series` or `DataFrame` is filled with `NaN` values for the “extra” elements. Otherwise,
  the extra values in the provided index are ignored.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed `AssertionError` in tree of binary operations.
- Fixed bug in `Series.dt.isocalendar` using a named Series
- Fixed `inplace` argument for Series objects derived from DataFrame columns.
- Fixed a bug where `Series.reindex` and `DataFrame.reindex` did not update the result index’s name correctly.
- Fixed a bug where `Series.take` did not give an error when `axis=1` was specified.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where using `to_pandas_batches` with async jobs caused an error due to improper
  handling of waiting for asynchronous query completion.

## Version 1.21.0 (2024-08-19)

### New features

- Added support for `snowflake.snowpark.testing.assert_dataframe_equal`, which is a utility function to check the equality of two Snowpark DataFrames.

### Improvements

- Added support for server-side string size limitations.
- Added support for creating and invoking stored procedures, UDFs and UDTFs with optional arguments.
- Added support for column lineage in the `DataFrame.lineage.trace` API.

- Added support for automatically cleaning up temporary tables created by `df.cache_result()` in the current session
  when the DataFrame is no longer referenced (i.e., gets garbage collected). It is still an experimental feature and not enabled by default.
  It can be enabled by setting `session.auto_clean_up_temp_table_enabled` to `True`.
- Added support for string literals to the `fmt` parameter of `snowflake.snowpark.functions.to_date`.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where the SQL generated for selecting `*` column has an incorrect subquery.
- Fixed a bug in `DataFrame.to_pandas_batches` where the iterator could throw an error if a certain transformation
  is made to the pandas DataFrame due to the wrong isolation level.
- Fixed a bug in `DataFrame.lineage.trace` to split the quoted feature view’s name and version correctly.
- Fixed a bug in `Column.isin` that caused invalid SQL generation when passed an empty list.

#### Improvements

- Added support for named aggregations in `DataFrame.aggregate` and `Series.aggregate` with `axis=0`.
- `pd.read_csv` reads using the native pandas CSV parser, then uploads data to Snowflake using parquet. This enables most of the parameters supported by `read_csv`, including date parsing and numeric conversions. Uploading via parquet is roughly twice as fast as uploading via CSV.

- Fixed a bug where `DataFrameWriter.save_as_table` did not raise exceptions when inserting null data into non-nullable columns.
- Fixed a bug in the implementation of `DataFrameWriter.save_as_table` where:
  - Append or truncate failed when incoming data had a different schema than the existing table.
  - Truncate failed when incoming data did not specify columns that are nullable.

#### Improvements

- Removed the dependency check for `pyarrow` because it is not used.
- Improved the target type coverage of `Column.cast`, adding support for casting to boolean and all integral types.
- Aligned the error experience when calling UDFs and stored procedures.
- Added appropriate error messages for the `is_permanent` and `anonymous` options in UDFs and stored procedures registration to
  make it clearer that those features are not yet supported.
- File read operations with unsupported options and values now raise `NotImplementedError` instead of warnings and unclear error
  information.

## Version 1.12.1 (2024-02-08)

Version 1.12.1 of the Snowpark library introduces some new features.

### Improvements

- Use `split_blocks=True` by default, during `to_pandas` conversion, for optimal memory allocation. This parameter is passed to `pyarrow.Table.to_pandas`, which enables `PyArrow`
  to split the memory allocation into smaller, more manageable blocks instead of allocating a single contiguous block. This results in better memory management when dealing with larger datasets.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in `DataFrame.to_pandas` that caused an error when evaluating on a Dataframe with an `IntegerType` column with null values.

## Version 1.12.0 (2024-01-29)

Version 1.12.0 of the Snowpark library introduces some new features.

### Behavior Changes (API Compatible)

- When parsing data types during a `to_pandas` operation, we rely on GS precision value to fix precision issues for large integer values. This may affect users where a column that was earlier returned as `int8` gets returned as `int64`. Users can fix this by explicitly specifying precision values for their return column.
- Aligned behavior for `Session.call` in case of table stored procedures where running `Session.call` would not trigger a stored procedure unless a `collect()` operation was performed.
- `StoredProcedureRegistration` now automatically adds `snowflake-snowpark-python` as a package dependency on the client’s local version of the library. An error is thrown if the server cannot support that version.

### New features

- Exposed `statement_params` in `StoredProcedure.__call__`.
- Added two optional arguments to `Session.add_import`:

  - `chunk_size`: The number of bytes to hash per chunk of the uploaded files.
  - `whole_file_hash`: By default only the first chunk of the uploaded import is hashed to save time. When this is set to True each uploaded file is fully hashed instead.
- Added parameters `external_access_integrations` and `secrets` when creating a UDAF from Snowpark Python to allow integration with external access.
- Added a new method `Session.append_query_tag`, which allows an additional tag to be added to the current query tag by appending it as a comma separated value.
- Added a new method `Session.update_query_tag`, which allows updates to a JSON encoded dictionary query tag.
- `SessionBuilder.getOrCreate` will now attempt to replace the singleton it returns when token expiration has been detected.
- Added the following functions in `snowflake.snowpark.functions`:

  - `array_except`
  - `create_map`
  - `sign` / `signum`
- Added the following functions to `DataFrame.analytics`:

  - Added the `moving_agg` function in `DataFrame.analytics` to enable moving aggregations like sums and averages with multiple window sizes.
  - Added the `cumulative_agg` function in `DataFrame.analytics` to enable moving aggregations like sums and averages with multiple window sizes.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in `DataFrame.na.fill` that caused Boolean values to erroneously override integer values.
- Fixed a bug in `Session.create_dataframe` where the Snowpark DataFrames created using pandas DataFrames were not inferring the type for timestamp columns correctly. The behavior is as follows:

  - Earlier timestamp columns without a timezone would be converted to nanosecond epochs and inferred as `LongType()`, but will now be correctly maintained as timestamp values and be inferred as `TimestampType(TimestampTimeZone.NTZ)`.
  - Earlier timestamp columns with a timezone would be inferred as `TimestampType(TimestampTimeZone.NTZ)` and lose timezone information but will now be correctly inferred as `TimestampType(TimestampTimeZone.LTZ)` and timezone information is retained correctly.
  - Set session parameter `PYTHON_SNOWPARK_USE_LOGICAL_TYPE_FOR_CREATE_DATAFRAME` to revert back to old behavior. Snowflake recommends that you update your code to align with correct behavior because the parameter will be removed in the future.
- Fixed a bug that `DataFrame.to_pandas` gets decimal type when scale is not 0, and creates an object dtype in `pandas`. Instead, we cast the value to a float64 type.
- Fixed bugs that wrongly flattened the generated SQL when one of the following happens:

  - `DataFrame.filter()` is called after `DataFrame.sort().limit()`.
  - `DataFrame.sort()` or `filter()` is called on a DataFrame that already has a window function or sequence-dependent data generator column.
    For instance, `df.select("a", seq1().alias("b")).select("a", "b").sort("a")` won’t flatten the sort clause anymore.
  - A window or sequence-dependent data generator column is used after `DataFrame.limit()`. For instance, `df.limit(10).select(row_number().over())` won’t flatten the limit and select in the generated SQL.
- Fixed a bug where aliasing a DataFrame column raised an error when the DataFrame was copied from another DataFrame with an aliased column. For instance,

  Copy code

  ```
  df = df.select(col("a").alias("b"))
  df = copy(df)
  df.select(col("b").alias("c"))  # Threw an error. Now it's fixed.
  ```
- Fixed a bug in `Session.create_dataframe` that the non-nullable field in a schema is not respected for Boolean type. Note that this fix is only effective when the user has the privilege to create a temp table.
- Fixed a bug in SQL simplifier where non-select statements in `session.sql` dropped a SQL query when used with `limit()`.
- Fixed a bug that raised an exception when session parameter `ERROR_ON_NONDETERMINISTIC_UPDATE` is true.
