# Packaging Handler Code

To make function or procedure handler code written in Java or Scala easier to reuse, you can build a JAR file that contains the handler and
its dependencies. When you create the function or procedure, you reference the handler JAR on a stage.

Topics in this section describe how to build handlers with commonly-used build tools.

For more information about using packaged handler code (as well as other dependencies) by referencing them on a stage, see
[Keeping handler code in-line or on a stage](/developer-guide/inline-or-staged).

Note

You can also use an IntelliJ IDEA project (not an SBT project in IntelliJ) to create the handler JAR. For more information, see the
[instructions on setting up an artifact configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/compiling-applications.html#configure_artifact).
