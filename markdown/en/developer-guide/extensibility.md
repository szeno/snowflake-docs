# Extending Snowflake with Functions and Procedures

You can extend the SQL you use in Snowflake by writing user-defined functions (UDFs) and stored procedures that you can call from SQL. When
you write a UDF or procedure, you write its logic in one of the supported handler languages, then create it using SQL.

With a UDF, you calculate and return a value. With a stored procedure, you generally perform one or more operations by executing
statements in SQL or another supported language.

You can also write an external function whose logic executes on a system external to Snowflake, such as a cloud provider.

[Choosing whether to write a stored procedure or a user-defined function](/developer-guide/stored-procedures-vs-udfs)
:   Choose between writing a stored procedure and writing a user-defined function.

:   Read more about the guidelines that functions and procedures share, including guidelines related to deployment options, security practices,
    platform constraints, and conventions.

[Packaging Handler Code](/developer-guide/udf-stored-procedure-building)
:   Use tools to package handler code and ensure that dependencies are available on Snowflake.

[Stored procedures overview](/developer-guide/stored-procedure/stored-procedures-overview)
:   Learn the benefits and supported languages.

[User-defined functions overview](/developer-guide/udf/udf-overview)
:   Learn the types of UDFs and supported languages.

[Logging, tracing, and metrics](/developer-guide/logging-tracing/logging-tracing-overview)
:   Record handler code activity by capturing log messages and trace events, storing the data in a database you can query later.

[External network access overview](/developer-guide/external-network-access/external-network-access-overview)
:   Create secure access to specific network locations external to Snowflake, then use that access from within the handler code.

[Introduction to external functions](/sql-reference/external-functions-introduction)
:   Access custom code that runs outside of Snowflake, such as API services that provide geocoding and machine learning models.
