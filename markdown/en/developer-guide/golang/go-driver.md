# Go Snowflake Driver

Note

This driver currently does not support GCP regional endpoints. Please ensure that any workloads using through this driver do not require support for regional endpoints on GCP. If you have questions about this, please contact Snowflake Support.

The Go Snowflake Driver provides an interface for developing applications using the Go programming language to connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations. The driver implements the Go
[database/sql](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql) package.

For a list of the operating systems supported by Snowflake clients, see [Operating system support](/release-notes/requirements#label-client-operating-system-support).

For complete installation instructions, as well as developer notes and the source code, see the GitHub [Go Snowflake Driver repo](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake).

For usage information, see the GoDoc [gosnowflake documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake).

## Verifying the network connection to Snowflake with SnowCD

After configuring your driver, you can evaluate and troubleshoot your network connectivity to Snowflake using [SnowCD](/user-guide/snowcd).

You can use SnowCD during the initial configuration process and on-demand at any time to evaluate and troubleshoot your network connection to Snowflake.

Important

Beginning with Snowflake version 8.24, network administrators have the option to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all connections to Snowflake. If your administrator decides to enable this feature, you must configure your client or driver to use MFA when connecting to Snowflake. For more information, see the following resources:
