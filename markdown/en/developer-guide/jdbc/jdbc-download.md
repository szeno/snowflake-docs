# Downloading / integrating the JDBC Driver

The JDBC driver (`snowflake-jdbc`) is provided as a JAR file, available as an artifact in Maven for download or for integration directly into your Java-based projects. Additionally, you can also download the following types of drivers from Maven:

- FIPS-compliant fat jar named `snowflake-jdbc-fips`.
- Thin jar named `snowflake-jdbc-thin`.

Source code for the additional types is the same, but their dependencies’ configurations are different, as follows:

- The FIPS-compliant fat jar does not embed the FIPS Bouncy Castle dependencies, so you need to provide them during runtime.
- The thin jar embeds only some dependencies, so you need to provide the other dependencies according to the pom file declaration.

All JAR types are released together with the same version number.

Before downloading or integrating the driver, you should verify the version of the driver you are currently using. To verify your driver version, connect to Snowflake through a client application
that uses the driver and check the driver version. If the application supports executing SQL queries, you can do this by calling the [CURRENT\_CLIENT](/sql-reference/functions/current_client) function.

## Requirements

For a list of the operating systems supported by Snowflake clients, see [Operating system support](/release-notes/requirements#label-client-operating-system-support).

## Downloading the desired type of driver

To download the driver, follow the steps for the desired driver type.

### Download a standard driver

To download the standard driver:

1. Go to the Maven Central Repository for the standard driver.

   > <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/snowflake-jdbc>
2. Select the directory for the version that you need.
   The most recent version (4.3.3) is not always at the end of the list. Versions are listed alphabetically,
   not numerically. For example, 3.10.x comes after 3.1.x, not after 3.9.x.
3. Download the appropriate `snowflake-jdbc-#.#.#.jar` file:

   > Note
   >
   > You can verify the JDBC driver version by entering the following command:
   >
   > `java -jar snowflake-jdbc-#.#.#.jar --version`, where `#.#.#` matches the version numbers in the downloaded file name.
4. Optional: To [verify the driver package signature](#label-jdbc-driver-verify-package), download the corresponding `snowflake-jdbc-#.#.#.jar.asc` file.

### Download a FIPS-compliant driver

To download the FIPS-compliant driver:

1. Go to the Maven Central Repository for the FIPS-compliant driver.

   > <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/snowflake-jdbc-fips>
2. Select the directory for the version that you need.
   The most recent version (4.3.3) is not always at the end of the list. Versions are listed alphabetically,
   not numerically. For example, 3.10.x comes after 3.1.x, not after 3.9.x.
3. Download the appropriate `snowflake-jdbc-fips-#.#.#.jar` file:

   > Note
   >
   > You can verify the JDBC driver version by entering the following command:
   >
   > `java -jar snowflake-jdbc-fips-#.#.#.jar --version`, where `#.#.#` matches the version numbers in the downloaded file name.
4. Optionally, you can [verify the driver package signature](#label-jdbc-driver-verify-package), download the corresponding `snowflake-jdbc-fips-#.#.#.jar.asc` file.

### Download a thin-jar driver

To download the thin-jar driver:

1. Go to the Maven Central Repository for the thin-jar driver.

   > <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/snowflake-jdbc-thin>
2. Select the directory for the version that you need.
   The most recent version (4.3.3) is not always at the end of the list. Versions are listed alphabetically,
   not numerically. For example, 3.10.x comes after 3.1.x, not after 3.9.x.
3. Download the appropriate `snowflake-jdbc-thin-#.#.#.jar` file:

   > Note
   >
   > You can verify the JDBC driver version by entering the following command:
   >
   > `java -jar snowflake-jdbc-thin-#.#.#.jar --version`, where `#.#.#` matches the version numbers in the downloaded file name.
4. Optionally, you can [verify the driver package signature](#label-jdbc-driver-verify-package), download the corresponding `snowflake-jdbc-thin-#.#.#.jar.asc` file.

## Optional: Verify the driver package signature

To verify the JDBC driver package signature:

1. From the public keyserver, download and import the Snowflake GPG public key for the version of the JDBC driver that you are
   using:

   - For version 3.22.0 and higher:

     ```
     $ gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 2A3149C82551A34A
     ```
   - For version 3.19.1 through 3.21.0:

     ```
     $ gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 5A125630709DD64B
     ```
   - For version 3.13.23 through 3.19.0:

     ```
     $ gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 630D9F3CAB551AF3
     ```
   - For version 3.12.13 through 3.13.22:

     ```
     $ gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 37C7086698CB005C
     ```
   - For version 3.6.26 through 3.12.12:

     ```
     $ gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EC218558EABB25A1
     ```
   - For version 3.6.25 and lower:

     ```
     $ gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 93DB296A69BE019A
     ```

     Note

     If this command fails with the following error:

     > Copy code
     >
     > ```
     > gpg: keyserver receive failed: Server indicated a failure
     > ```

     then specify that you want to use port 80 for the keyserver:

     > Copy code
     >
     > ```
     > gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80  ...
     > ```
2. Run the `gpg --verify` command to verify the signature of the package.

   For the `--verify` command-line flag, specify the `.asc` file that you
   [downloaded earlier](#label-jdbc-driver-download) as the signature file and the JAR file as the file containing the signed
   data.

   For example:

   ```
   $ gpg --verify snowflake-jdbc-4.3.3.jar.asc snowflake-jdbc-4.3.3.jar
   gpg: Signature made Wed 22 Feb 2017 04:31:58 PM UTC using RSA key ID <gpg_key_id>
   gpg: Good signature from "Snowflake Computing <snowflake_gpg@snowflake.net>"
   ```

   Specify the correct version numbers for the JDBC driver package you are verifying. Version 4.3.3 is used in this
   example for illustration purposes only. The latest available version of the driver may be higher.

   Note

   Verifying the signature produces a warning similar to the following:

   > Copy code
   >
   > ```
   > gpg: Signature made Mon 24 Sep 2018 03:03:45 AM UTC using RSA key ID <gpg_key_id>
   > gpg: Good signature from "Snowflake Computing <snowflake_gpg@snowflake.net>" unknown
   > gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
   > gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
   > ```

   To avoid the warning, you can grant the Snowflake GPG public key implicit trust.
3. Your local environment can contain multiple GPG keys; however, for security reasons, Snowflake periodically rotates the public GPG key. As a best practice, we recommend deleting the existing public key
   after confirming that the latest key works with the latest signed package:

   Copy code

   ```
   $ gpg --delete-key "Snowflake Computing"
   ```

## Integrate the driver into a maven project

To integrate the driver into a Maven project:

- Add the driver as a dependency to your `pom.xml` file.

For example:

- Standard driver

  ```
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
   <groupId>net.snowflake</groupId>
   <artifactId>snowflake-jdbc</artifactId>
   <version>4.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
  </dependencies>
  ```
- FIPS-compliant driver

  ```
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
   <groupId>net.snowflake</groupId>
   <artifactId>snowflake-jdbc-fips</artifactId>
   <version>4.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
  </dependencies>
  ```
- Thin-jar driver

  ```
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
   <groupId>net.snowflake</groupId>
   <artifactId>snowflake-jdbc-thin</artifactId>
   <version>4.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
  </dependencies>
  ```

where the `<version>` tag specifies the version of the driver you want to integrate. Note that version 4.3.3 is used in this example for illustration purposes only. A later version of the driver might be available.

The developer notes are hosted along with the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc).

## Add the JNA classes to your classpath

[Connection caching for browser-based SSO](/user-guide/admin-security-fed-auth-use#label-browser-based-sso-connection-caching) and
[token caching for multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/user-guide/security-mfa#label-mfa-token-caching) require the use of the
[Java Native Access (JNA) classes](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/master/README.md) to save data securely to the
filesystem.

As of version 3.12.18 of the JDBC Driver, the JNA classes are no longer packaged in the JDBC Driver JAR file. In the JDBC Driver
`pom.xml` file, the dependencies on these classes are marked as optional.

If you need to use connection caching or token caching, you must add the following libraries to your classpath:

- For Mac and Linux:

  - [JNA](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.java.dev.jna/jna)
- For Windows:

  - [JNA](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.java.dev.jna/jna)
  - [JNA Platform](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.java.dev.jna/jna-platform)

The `pom.xml` file for the JDBC Driver specifies the version of the JNA classes that have been tested with the JDBC Driver. Snowflake recommends using this version (or the same major version) of
the JNA classes.

For more information, see [JDBC Driver page in the Maven Central Repository](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=g%3Anet.snowflake%20snowflake-jdbc).

Note

For systems that use the aarch64 architecture (e.g. the Apple M1 chip), use version 5.7.0 or later of the JNA libraries.
(JNA versions prior to v5.7.0 are not compatible with Windows and macOS systems that run on aarch64.)
