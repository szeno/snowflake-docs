# Tutorial 7:Create a Snowpark Container Services service that uses caller’s rights

## Introduction

In this tutorial you explore building a service, presenting a web UI, that uses the caller’s rights feature when executing SQL queries on behalf of the users.

You create a service (named `query_service`) that executes a query provided in the request. By default, application containers connect to Snowflake as the service user using the service’s owner role. But this application uses the caller’s rights feature to connect to the service endpoint as the end user and using privileges granted to that user.

When testing, you use the service from a web browser because the caller’s rights feature is only supported when accessing a service using network ingress. The caller’s rights feature is not available when accessing a service using a service function.

The service does the following:

- Exposes one public endpoint.
- When a user logs in to the endpoint, the service provides a Web UI to provide a query. The service executes the query in Snowflake and returns the results. In this tutorial you execute the following SQL command:

  Copy code

  ```
  SELECT CURRENT_USER(), CURRENT_ROLE();
  ```

  The command returns the name of the currently logged-in user and the currently active role, both of which depend on whether caller’s rights is used.

  - When caller’s rights is used, the service connects to Snowflake as the calling user and the user’s default role. The command returns your user name and default role.
  - When caller’s rights is not used, the default behavior kicks in where the service connects to Snowflake as the service user and the service’s owner role. Therefore, the command returns the service user name in the form: `SF$SERVICE$unique-id`, `TEST_ROLE`.

There are two parts to this tutorial:

**Part 1: Create and test a service.** You download code provided for this tutorial and follow step-by-step instructions:

1. Download the service code for this tutorial.
2. Build a Docker image for Snowpark Container Services, and upload the image to a repository in your account.
3. Create a service.
4. Communicate with the service using network ingress to connect with the public endpoint that the service exposes. Using a web browser, you login to the public endpoint and execute the SELECT CURRENT\_USER(); command. Verify the command output to ensure that the container executed the command as the logged-in user.

**Part 2: Understand the service**. This section provides an overview of the service code and highlights how the application code uses the caller’s rights.

## Prepare

Follow [Common Setup](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/tutorials/common-setup) to configure prerequisites and create snowflake resources that are required for all Snowpark Container Services tutorials provided in this documentation.

## Download the service code

Code (a Python application) is provided to create the query service.

1. Download [SnowparkContainerServices-Tutorials.zip](/static/samples/spcs/SnowparkContainerServices-Tutorials.zip).
2. Unzip the content, which includes one directory for each tutorial. The `Tutorial-6-callers-rights` directory has the following files:
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `main.py`
   - `templates/basic_ui.html`

## Build an image and upload

Build an image for the linux/amd64 platform that Snowpark Container Services supports, and then upload the image to the image
repository in your account (see [Common Setup](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/tutorials/common-setup)).

You will need information about the repository (the repository URL and the registry hostname) before you can build and upload the image. For more information, see
[Registry and Repositories](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-registry-repository).

**Get information about the repository**

1. To get the repository URL, execute the [SHOW IMAGE REPOSITORIES](/sql-reference/sql/show-image-repositories) SQL command.

   Copy code

   ```
   SHOW IMAGE REPOSITORIES;
   ```

   - The `repository_url` column in the output provides the URL. An example is shown:

     ```
     <orgname>-<acctname>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/tutorial_db/data_schema/tutorial_repository
     ```
   - The host name in the repository URL is the registry host name. An example is shown:

     ```
     <orgname>-<acctname>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com
     ```

**Build image and upload it to the repository**

1. Open a terminal window, and change to the directory containing the files you unzipped.
2. To build a Docker image, execute the following `docker build` command using the Docker CLI.
   Note that the command specifies the current working directory (`.`)
   as the `PATH` for files to use to build the image.

   Copy code

   ```
   docker build --rm --platform linux/amd64 -t <repository_url>/<image_name> .
   ```

   - For `image_name`, use `query_service:latest`.

   **Example**

   Copy code

   ```
   docker build --rm --platform linux/amd64 -t myorg-myacct.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/tutorial_db/data_schema/tutorial_repository/query_service:latest .
   ```
3. Upload the image to the repository in your Snowflake account. For Docker to upload an image on your behalf to your repository,
   you must first authenticate Docker with Snowflake.

   1. For Docker to upload an image on your behalf to your repository,
      first [authenticate Docker with the registry](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-registry-repository#label-registry-and-repository-authentication).

      1. We recommend using [Snowflake CLI](/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/index)
         to authenticate your local Docker instance with the image
         registry for your Snowflake account. Make sure that you configured Snowflake CLI to connect to Snowflake. For more information,
         see [Configuring Snowflake CLI and connecting to Snowflake](/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/connecting/connect).
      2. To authenticate, execute the following Snowflake CLI command:

         Copy code

         ```
         snow spcs image-registry login
         ```
   2. To upload the image, execute the following command:

      Copy code

      ```
      docker push <repository_url>/<image_name>
      ```

      **Example**

      Copy code

      ```
      docker push myorg-myacct.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/tutorial_db/data_schema/tutorial_repository/query_service:latest
      ```

## Create a service

In this section you create a service (query\_service).

1. Verify that the compute pool is ready and that you are in the right context to create the service.

   1. Previously, you set the context in the [Common Setup](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/tutorials/common-setup#label-snowpark-containers-common-setup-create-objects) step. To ensure that you’re in the right context for the SQL statements in this step, execute the following:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE test_role;
   USE DATABASE tutorial_db;
   USE SCHEMA data_schema;
   USE WAREHOUSE tutorial_warehouse;
   ```

   1. To ensure that the compute pool you created in the [common setup](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/tutorials/common-setup#label-snowpark-containers-common-setup-create-objects) is ready, execute `DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL`, and verify that the `state` is `ACTIVE` or `IDLE`. If the `state` is `STARTING`, you need to wait until the `state` changes to either `ACTIVE` or `IDLE`.

   Copy code

   ```
   DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL tutorial_compute_pool;
   ```
2. To create the service, execute the following command using `test_role`:

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE SERVICE query_service
     IN COMPUTE POOL tutorial_compute_pool
     FROM SPECIFICATION $$
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: /tutorial_db/data_schema/tutorial_repository/query_service:latest
        env:
          SERVER_PORT: 8000
        readinessProbe:
          port: 8000
          path: /healthcheck
      endpoints:
      - name: execute
        port: 8000
        public: true
    capabilities:
      securityContext:
        executeAsCaller: true
    serviceRoles:
    - name: ui_usage
      endpoints:
      - execute
   $$;
   ```

   Note

   If a service with that name already exists, use the DROP SERVICE command to delete the previously created service, and then
   create this service.
3. Execute the following SQL commands to get detailed information about the service you just created. For more information, see
   [Snowpark Container Services: Working with services](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services).

   - To list services in your account, execute the SHOW SERVICES command:

     Copy code

     ```
     SHOW SERVICES;
     ```
   - To get the status of your service, execute the SHOW SERVICE CONTAINERS IN SERVICE command:

     Copy code

     ```
     SHOW SERVICE CONTAINERS IN SERVICE query_service;
     ```
   - To get information about your service, execute the DESCRIBE SERVICE command:

     Copy code

     ```
     DESCRIBE SERVICE query_service;
     ```

## Use the service

In this section you verify that the [caller’s rights](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/spcs-execute-sql#label-spcs-additional-considerations-configuring-callers-rights) configured for the service work. You log in to the public endpoint from a browser, execute a query, and verify that the Snowflake session that the service created operates as the calling user, instead of as the service user.

First, to set up the context for the SQL statements in this section, execute the following:

Copy code

```
USE ROLE test_role;
USE DATABASE tutorial_db;
USE SCHEMA data_schema;
USE WAREHOUSE tutorial_warehouse;
```

The service exposes a public endpoint (see the inline specification provided in the CREATE SERVICE command); therefore, first log in to the endpoint using a web browser, then use the web UI that the service exposes to the internet to send query requests to the service endpoint.

1. Find the URL of the public endpoint that the service exposes:

   Copy code

   ```
   SHOW ENDPOINTS IN SERVICE query_service;
   ```

   The `ingress_url` column in the response provides the URL.

   **Example**

   ```
   p6bye-myorg-myacct.snowflakecomputing.app
   ```
2. Append `/ui` to the endpoint URL, and paste it in the web browser. This causes the service to execute the `ui()` function (see `main.py`).

   Note that the first time you access the endpoint URL, you will be asked to log in to Snowflake.
3. Use the same user that you used to create the service. Upon successful login, the service shows the following Web UI.

   ![Web form to communicate with query service.](/static/images/spcs/spcs-tutorial-query-service-10.png)

   Enter the following command in the text box and press enter to see the results.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT CURRENT_USER(), CURRENT_ROLE()DONE;
   ```

   Because you included the `executeAsCaller` capability in the service specification, when a request arrives, Snowflake inserts the `Sf-Context-Current-User-Token` header in the request and then forwards the request to your service endpoint.

   For illustration purposes, the service code in this tutorial executes the query both as the caller and the service user.

   ![Web form to communicate with the query service.](/static/images/spcs/spcs-tutorial-query-service-20.png)
   - **Executes the query on behalf of the caller (ingress user):** In this case, the code uses the user token that Snowflake provides to construct a login token for connecting with Snowflake. Thus, the service uses the caller’s rights. Snowflake executes the query on behalf of the caller, displaying the caller’s name and active role name in the query result. For example:

     ```
     ['TESTUSER, PUBLIC']
     ```
   - **Executes the query on behalf of the service user:** In this case, the code doesn’t use the user token that Snowflake provides in the request when constructing the login token to connect with Snowflake. Thus, the service doesn’t utilize the caller’s rights, causing Snowflake to execute the query on behalf of the service user. The query result shows the service user’s name (which is the same as the service name) and the active role.

     ```
     ['QUERY_SERVICE, TEST_ROLE']
     ```

When the service executes the query (`SELECT CURRENT_USER(), CURRENT_ROLE();`) on behalf of the caller, Snowflake doesn’t need the user’s warehouse to execute this simple query. Therefore, the service didn’t need any [caller grants](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/spcs-execute-sql#label-spcs-granting-caller-permissions-to-service). In the next section, the service executes a non-trivial query on behalf of the calling user that requires you to grant [caller grants](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/spcs-execute-sql#label-spcs-granting-caller-permissions-to-service) to the service.

Note

You can access the ingress endpoint programmatically. For sample code, see [Ingress authentication](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services#label-snowpark-containers-service-public-endpoint-access). Note that you need to append `/ui` to the endpoint URL in the code so that Snowflake can route the request to the `ui()` function in the service code.

## Use the service with caller grants

In this section, the service executes the following query on behalf of the caller (the user who logs in the service’s ingress endpoint).

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM ingress_user_db.ingress_user_schema.ingress_user_table;
```

The service doesn’t have permissions to access the table and doesn’t have permission to run the query in the default warehouse. To enable the service to execute this query on behalf of the caller, you grant the required [caller grants](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/spcs-execute-sql#label-spcs-granting-caller-permissions-to-service) to the service.

To demonstrate the scenario, you create a new role (`ingress_user_role`) and a table (`ingress_user_table`) that’s accessible to the new role but not to the service’s owner role (`test_role`). Therefore, when the service attempts to execute the query using the service credentials, Snowflake returns an error. But when the service executes the query on behalf of the user, Snowflake executes the query and returns the result.

### Create roles and resources

1. Create a role (`ingress_user_role`) and a database (`ingress_user_db`) that only this role can access. You then grant this role to the your user, so that the user can log in to the service’s public endpoint and query this table.

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE accountadmin;

   CREATE ROLE ingress_user_role;
   GRANT ROLE ingress_user_role TO USER <your_user_name>;

   GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE tutorial_warehouse TO ROLE ingress_user_role;

   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ingress_user_db;
   GRANT OWNERSHIP ON DATABASE ingress_user_db TO ROLE ingress_user_role COPY CURRENT GRANTS;
   ```
2. Create a table (`ingress_user_table`) that only the `ingress_user_role` role can access.

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE ingress_user_role;

   CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS ingress_user_db.ingress_user_schema;
   USE WAREHOUSE tutorial_warehouse;
   CREATE TABLE ingress_user_db.ingress_user_schema.ingress_user_table (col string) AS (
    SELECT 'this table is only accessible to the ingress_user_role'
   );
   ```

   Note that when the service tries to query the table on behalf of the caller, the service operates only as a `test_role`, the role that was used to create the service (the service’s owner role). This role does not have permissions to access the user table.
3. Grant caller grants to the service’s owner role (`test_role`) to query tables in the `ingress_user_db` database. This privilege allows the service to query tables in this database only if the following are true:

   - The service is using a [caller’s rights session](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/spcs-execute-sql#label-spcs-granting-caller-permissions-to-service).
   - In the session, the caller also has permission to execute these queries.

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE accountadmin;

   GRANT CALLER USAGE ON DATABASE ingress_user_db TO ROLE test_role;
   GRANT INHERITED CALLER USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE ingress_user_db TO ROLE test_role;
   GRANT INHERITED CALLER SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE ingress_user_db TO ROLE test_role;
   GRANT CALLER USAGE ON WAREHOUSE tutorial_warehouse TO ROLE test_role;
   SHOW CALLER GRANTS TO ROLE test_role;
   ```
4. Configure the default warehouse and default secondary roles.

   When a session is created for a user, Snowflake activates the default primary role, default secondary roles, and the default warehouse of the logged-in user. In this tutorial,

   - You set the `DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES` to ALL so that when a session is created for the current user, Snowflake sets the current secondary roles to be all roles granted to the user.
   - You also set the default warehouse to `tutorial_warehouse` where the `ingress_user_table` queries are executed.

   Copy code

   ```
   ALTER USER SET DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES = ('ALL');
   ALTER USER SET DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = TUTORIAL_WAREHOUSE;
   ```

   Note the following:

   - In this tutorial, you log in to the public endpoint of the service. The user has `test_role` as the primary role and the `ingress_user_role` as the secondary role. This allows the session to do anything that the `ingress_user_role` allows.
   - The default role and default warehouse only affect the role and warehouse activated when the service establishes a session on behalf of your user. After a caller’s rights session is established you cannot change the role, but you can change the warehouse.

### Use the service and test the caller grants

1. Find the URL of the public endpoint that the service exposes:

   Copy code

   ```
   SHOW ENDPOINTS IN SERVICE tutorial_db.data_schema.query_service;
   ```

   The `ingress_url` column in the response provides the URL.

   **Example**

   ```
   p6bye-myorg-myacct.snowflakecomputing.app
   ```
2. Append `/ui` to the endpoint URL, and paste it in the web browser. This causes the service to execute the `ui()` function
   (see `echo_service.py`).:
   Note that the first time you access the endpoint URL, you will be asked to log in to Snowflake. For this test, use the same user that
   you used to create the service to ensure that the user has the necessary privileges.:
3. Use the same user that you used to create the service. Upon successful login, the service shows the following Web UI.

   ![Web form to communicate with the query service.](/static/images/spcs/spcs-tutorial-query-service-10.png)

   Enter the following command in the text box and press enter to see the results.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT * FROM ingress_user_db.ingress_user_schema.ingress_user_table;
   ```

   For illustration purposes the service code in this tutorial executes the query both as the caller and the service user.

   - **Executes the query on behalf of the caller (ingress user):** In this case, the code uses the user token provided by Snowflake to construct a login token for connecting with Snowflake. Thus, the service uses the caller’s rights. Snowflake executes the query on behalf of the caller. Because the caller is using the `ingress_user_role role` that has the privilege to query the `ingress_user_table` table, the query returns one row in the result:

     ```
     ['this table is only accessible to ingress_user_role']
     ```
   - **Executes the query on behalf of the service user:** In this case, the code does not use the user token that Snowflake provides in the request when constructing the login token to connect with Snowflake. Thus, Snowflake executes the query on behalf of the service user. Because the service owner uses the default `test_role`, which does not have permission to query the table, you see an error:

     ```
     Encountered an error when executing query:... SQL compilation error: Database 'INGRESS_USER_DB' does not exist or not authorized.
     ```![Web form to communicate with echo service.](/static/images/spcs/Tutorial-6-restricted-callers-rights-10.png)

## Cleanup

You should remove billable resources that you created. For more information, see Step 5 in
[Tutorial 4](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/tutorials/advanced/tutorial-4).

## Reviewing the service code

This section covers the following topics:

- [Examining the tutorial code](#label-snowpark-containers-tutorial-6-step-5a): Review the code files that implement the query service.

### Examining the tutorial code

The zip file you downloaded in Step 1 includes the following files:

- `Dockerfile`
- `main.py`
- `templates/basic_ui.html`

You also use service specification when creating the service. The following section explains how these code components work together to create the service.

#### main.py file

This Python file contains the code that implements a minimal HTTP server that executes a query in the request and returns query results. The code
provides a web user interface (UI) for submitting echo requests.

                return "Encountered an error when executing query: " + str(e)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Encountered an error when connecting to Snowflake: " + str(e)

```

In the code:

- The `ui` function displays the following web form and handles query requests submitted from the web form.

  ![Web form to communicate with query service.](/static/images/spcs/spcs-tutorial-query-service-10.png)

  This function uses the `@app.route()` decorator to specify that requests for `/ui` are handled by this function:

  Copy code

  ```
  @app.route("/ui", methods=["GET", "POST"])
  def ui():
  ```

  The query service exposes the `execute` endpoint publicly (see the inline service specification you provided when creating the service), enabling communication with
  the service over the web. When you load the URL of the public endpoint with /ui appended in your browser, the browser sends
  an HTTP GET request for this path, and the server routes the request to this function. The function executes and returns a
  simple HTML form for the user to enter a query.

  After the user enters a query and submits the form, the browser sends an HTTP POST request for this path. Because the service specification includes the `executeAsCaller` capability, Snowflake adds the `Sf-Context-Current-User-Token` header to the incoming request and forwards the request to this same function (see [Connecting to Snowflake using caller’s rights](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/spcs-execute-sql#label-spcs-additional-considerations-configuring-callers-rights)).

  The code executes the `run_query` function twice:

  - As the ingress user. In this case, the login token is concatenation of both OAuth token and ingress user token.

    Copy code

    ```
    token = get_login_token() + "." + ingress_user_token
    ```
  - As the service user. In this case the login token is only the OAuth token.

    Copy code

    ```
    token = get_login_token()
    ```
- The `readiness_probe` function uses the `@app.get()` decorator to specify that requests for `/healthcheck`
  are handled by this function:

  Copy code

  ```
  @app.get("/healthcheck")
  def readiness_probe():
  ```

  This function enables Snowflake to check the readiness of the service. When the container starts, Snowflake wants to confirm
  that the application is working and that the service is ready to serve the requests. Snowflake sends an HTTP GET request with
  this path (as a health probe, readiness probe) to ensure that only healthy containers serve traffic. The function can do
  whatever you want.
- The `get_logger` function helps set up logging.

#### Dockerfile

This file contains all the commands to build an image using Docker.

Copy code

```
ARG BASE_IMAGE=python:3.10-slim-buster
FROM $BASE_IMAGE
COPY main.py ./
COPY templates/ ./templates/
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install flask snowflake-snowpark-python
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

The Dockerfile contains instructions to install the Flask library ind the Docker container. The code in `main.py`
relies on the Flask library to handle HTTP requests.

#### /template/basic\_ui.html

The query service exposes the `echoendpoint` endpoint publicly (see service specification), enabling communication with the
service over the web. When you load the public endpoint URL with `/ui` appended in your browser, the query service displays
this form.

![Web form to communicate with query service.](/static/images/spcs/spcs-tutorial-query-service-10.png)

You can enter a query in the form and submit the form, and the service returns the results in an HTTP response.

Copy code

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Welcome to the query service!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to the query service!</h1>
    <form action="{{ url_for("ui") }}" method="post">
      <label for="query">query:<label><br />
      <input type="text" id="query" name="query" size="50"><br />
    </form>
    <h2>Query:</h2>
    {{ query_input }}
    <h2>Result (executed on behalf of ingress user):</h2>
    {{ query_result_ingress_user }}
    <h2>Result (executed as service user):</h2>
    {{ query_result_service_user }}
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Service specification

Snowflake uses information you provide in this specification to configure and run your service.

Copy code

```
spec:
  containers:
  - name: main
    image: /tutorial_db/data_schema/tutorial_repository/query_service:latest
    env:
      SERVER_PORT: 8000
    readinessProbe:
      port: 8000
      path: /healthcheck
  endpoints:
  - name: execute
    port: 8000
    public: true
capabilities:
  securityContext:
    executeAsCaller: true
serviceRoles:
- name: ui_usage
  endpoints:
  - execute
```

In the service specification, the `spec`, `capabilities`, and `serviceRoles` are the top-level fields.

- `spec` provides specification details (see [Service specification reference](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/specification-reference)). Note that the service exposes one public endpoint (`execute`) that enables ingress access to the service from the public web.
- `capabilities` Specifies the `executeAsCaller` capability. This tells Snowflake that the application intends to use [caller’s rights](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/spcs-execute-sql#label-spcs-additional-considerations-configuring-callers-rights).
- `serviceRoles` specifies one service role (`ui_usage`) and endpoint name (`execute`) to grant the USAGE privilege on.
- The `readinessProbe` field identifies the `port` and `path` that Snowflake can use to send an HTTP GET
  request to the readiness probe to verify that the service is ready to handle traffic.

  The service code (`echo_python.py`) implements the readiness probe as follows:

  Copy code

  ```
  @app.get("/healthcheck")
  def readiness_probe():
  ```

  Therefore, the specification file includes the `container.readinessProbe` field accordingly.

For more information about service specifications, see [Service specification reference](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/specification-reference).
