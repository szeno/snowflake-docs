# Tutorial: Get started with logging and tracing

## Introduction

This tutorial introduces the basics of emitting, collecting, and querying log and trace data from function and procedure handler code.

The tutorial uses the Snowsight web interface, but you can use any Snowflake client that supports executing SQL. For more
information about Snowsight, see [Getting started with worksheets](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-worksheets-gs) and [Work with worksheets in Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-worksheets).

### What you will learn

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Create an event table to store log and trace data.

  Snowflake collects log and trace data in the table’s predefined structure.
- Emit log messages and trace data from a user-defined function (UDF).

  You can use an API designed for your handler language to emit log messages and trace data from handler code.
- View the collected log and trace data by querying the event table.

  You can query the table with a SELECT statement to analyze the collected data.

### Prerequisites

- You must execute all of the SQL commands in the same SQL command session because the session context is required.

  To do this in Snowsight, for example, paste all of your code into the same worksheet as you go along. As you progress from
  section to section, each section builds on the previous.
- You must be able to use the ACCOUNTADMIN role.

  In this tutorial, you will perform all the steps using the ACCOUNTADMIN role. In general practice, however, you would use roles
  with privileges specifically defined for the action you’re performing. For example, you might have separate roles for developers who
  create UDFs, for analysts who query collected log and trace data, and so on.

  For more about roles, see [Switch your primary role](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-switching-your-active-role) and [Access control best practices](/user-guide/security-access-control-considerations).

## Set up the database, warehouse, and access

In this section, you’ll create a warehouse and database you’ll need for the tutorial. You’ll also begin using the ACCOUNTADMIN role, which
is required to execute some of the statements in this tutorial.

You’re creating a database in which you’ll later create the event table and the user-defined function. You can delete all of the objects
you create in the tutorial, including the database and warehouse, when you no longer need them.

To create a database and warehouse for use in the tutorial:

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the lower-left corner, select your name » **Switch role** » **ACCOUNTADMIN**.
3. At the top of the navigation menu, select [![Add a dashboard tile](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-dashboards-add-tile-icon.png)](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-dashboards-add-tile-icon.png) (**Create**) » **SQL Worksheet**.
4. [Rename the new worksheet](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-worksheets#label-worksheets-manage) to `Logging-tracing tutorial`.
5. In the new worksheet, paste and run the following statement to create a database. The new database is just for this tutorial.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE tutorial_log_trace_db;
   ```
6. Paste and run the following statement to create a warehouse. The new warehouse is just for this tutorial.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE tutorial_log_trace_wh
     WAREHOUSE_TYPE = STANDARD
     WAREHOUSE_SIZE = XSMALL;
   ```

In this section, you put in place the pieces you need for the tutorial. In the next section, you’ll create an event table for storing
log and trace data.

## Create an event table

In this section, you’ll create an event table. As your handler code emits log messages and trace data, Snowflake saves the emitted data in
event table rows. You can query the event table to analyze the data.

You must create an event table to collect log and trace data. An event table always uses the
[predefined structure](/developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-columns) defined by Snowflake.

Important

To complete this section, you’ll need to be able to use the ACCOUNTADMIN role, which is required when altering an account so that the new event
table is the account’s active event table.

To create the event table, you must use a role with the CREATE EVENT TABLE privilege assigned.

To create the event table and make it the active event table for the account:

1. Paste and run the following statement to create an event table.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE EVENT TABLE tutorial_event_table;
   ```

   This table is where Snowflake stores log and trace data.
2. Paste and run the following statement to alter the account so that the event table you created is the active one for the account.

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

   ALTER ACCOUNT SET EVENT_TABLE = tutorial_log_trace_db.public.tutorial_event_table;
   ```

   This statement sets the new event table as the table that Snowflake should use for storing log messages and trace data from handlers
   in the current account. You can have only one active event table for an account.

In this section, you created an event table. In the next section, you’ll start emitting log messages that Snowflake stores in the table.

## Emit log messages

In this section, you’ll create a user-defined function (UDF) with Python handler code that emits log messages. As your code emits log
messages, Snowflake collects the message data and stores it in the event table you created.

Snowflake supports APIs to log messages from each supported handler language. For handlers you write in Python, you can use the
`logging` module in Python’s standard library.

To create a UDF that emits log messages:

1. Paste and run the following statement to set the log level to `INFO`.

   Copy code

   ```
   ALTER SESSION SET LOG_LEVEL = INFO;
   ```

   This specifies the severity of log messages that Snowflake should capture as the UDF runs. In this case, the level permits all
   messages ranging from informational (`INFO`) to the most severe (`FATAL`).
2. Paste and run the following statement to create a user-defined function.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_trace_data()
   RETURNS VARCHAR
   LANGUAGE PYTHON
   RUNTIME_VERSION = 3.12
   HANDLER = 'run'
   AS $$
   import logging
   logger = logging.getLogger("tutorial_logger")

   def run():
     logger.info("Logging from Python function.")
     return "SUCCESS"
   $$;
   ```

   Highlighted lines in the code do the following:

   - Import the Python `logging` module so that the handler code can use it.
   - Create a logger, which exposes the interface your code will use to log messages.
   - Log a message at the `INFO` level.
3. Paste and run the following statement to execute the function you just created.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT log_trace_data();
   ```

   This produces the following output. In addition, as the function executed, it emitted a log message that Snowflake collected in the
   event table.

   ```
   --------------------
   | LOG_TRACE_DATA() |
   --------------------
   | SUCCESS          |
   --------------------
   ```

In this section, you emitted a log message from a UDF. In the next section, you’ll query the event table to retrieve data related to the message.

## Query for log messages

In this section, you’ll query the event table for log message data emitted by the UDF you ran in the previous section.

Note

It can take several seconds for log or trace data emitted by handler code to be recorded in the event table. If you don’t see
results immediately, try again in a few seconds.

Snowflake uses [predefined event table columns](/developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-columns) to collect and store log and
trace data of the following kinds:

- **Data you emit from handler code**, such as log messages and trace event data.

  You’ll find these in columns such as RECORD\_TYPE, RECORD, RECORD\_ATTRIBUTES, and others.
- **Data about the context** in which the log or trace data was emitted, such as the timestamp, name of the handler method from which the data
  was emitted, and so on.

  You’ll find this data in columns such as RESOURCE\_ATTRIBUTES, TIMESTAMP, and SCOPE.

To query the event table for log message data:

1. Paste and run the following statement to query the event table.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT
     TIMESTAMP AS time,
     RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES['snow.executable.name'] as executable,
     RECORD['severity_text'] AS severity,
     VALUE AS message
   FROM
     tutorial_log_trace_db.public.tutorial_event_table
   WHERE
     RECORD_TYPE = 'LOG'
     AND SCOPE['name'] = 'tutorial_logger';
   ```

   Some columns contain structured data expressed as key-value pairs. In this query, you specify attribute keys within a column by using
   [bracket notation](/user-guide/querying-semistructured#label-bracket-notation-when-querying-semistructured-data) such as `RECORD['severity_text']`.

   You also use bracket notation (`SCOPE['name']`) to specify that you want to select column values only where the log entries are
   emitted with the Python logger, `tutorial_logger`, you created in handler code.
2. View the output.

   ```
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | TIME                | EXECUTABLE                           | SEVERITY | MESSAGE                         |
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | 2023-04-19 22:00:49 | "LOG_TRACE_DATA():VARCHAR(16777216)" | "INFO"   | "Logging from Python function." |
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

   The output illustrates how the [event table’s predefined columns](/developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-columns) each
   contain parts of the collected data. For the `EXECUTABLE` and `SEVERITY` values, you’ve used bracket notation
   to specify the attributes whose values you want.

   > | Output Column | Description |
   > | --- | --- |
   > | TIME | The time the entry was created (from the TIMESTAMP column). |
   > | EXECUTABLE | UDF name and parameters (from the RESOURCE\_ATTRIBUTES column’s `snow.executable.name` attribute). |
   > | SEVERITY | Log entry severity (from the RECORD column’s `severity_text` attribute). |
   > | MESSAGE | Log message (from the VALUE column). |
   >
   > Expand
   >
   > Show lessSee more

In this section, you used a SELECT statement to query for log data. In the next section, you’ll update the UDF so that it emits trace data.

## Emit trace data

In this section, you’ll update the UDF handler code so that it also emits trace data. As your code emits trace data, Snowflake collects
the data and stores it in the event table you created.

Trace data has structural qualities, including event data grouped into spans and data captured as key-value pairs, that let
you assemble a more detailed picture of your code’s activity than log data typically allows.

Snowflake supports APIs to emit trace data from each supported handler language. For handlers you write in Python, you can use the
Snowflake `telemetry` package.

To update the UDF to emit trace data:

1. Paste and run the following statement to specify what trace data should be captured.

   Copy code

   ```
   ALTER SESSION SET TRACE_LEVEL = ON_EVENT;
   ```

   This sets the trace level to `ON_EVENT`. This specifies that only trace data emitted explicitly by your own code should be
   captured.
2. Paste and run the following statement to create a UDF that emits trace data.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_trace_data()
   RETURNS VARCHAR
   LANGUAGE PYTHON
   RUNTIME_VERSION = 3.12
   HANDLER = 'run'
   AS $$
   import logging
   logger = logging.getLogger("tutorial_logger")
   from snowflake import telemetry

   def run():
     telemetry.set_span_attribute("example.proc.run", "begin")
     telemetry.add_event("event_with_attributes", {"example.key1": "value1", "example.key2": "value2"})
     logger.info("Logging from Python function.")
     return "SUCCESS"
   $$;
   ```

   By running this code, you’re replacing the function you created earlier with one that adds code for emitting trace data. The highlighted
   lines do the following:

   - Import the `telemetry` package so you can call its functions.
   - Set an attribute and attribute value to the span that Snowflake creates when the code runs.

     A span represents a procedure’s or UDF’s execution unit, within which you can add multiple events.
   - Add an event (with its own attributes) to record as part of the span.
3. Paste and run the following statement to execute the function you just created.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT log_trace_data();
   ```

   This produces the following output. In addition, as the function executed, it emitted trace data that Snowflake collected in the
   event table.

   ```
   --------------------
   | LOG_TRACE_DATA() |
   --------------------
   | SUCCESS          |
   --------------------
   ```

In this section, you emitted trace data from a UDF. In the next section, you’ll query the event table to retrieve data related to the trace.

## Query for trace messages

In this section, you’ll query the event table for trace data emitted by the UDF you ran in the previous section.

Note

It can take several seconds for log or trace data emitted by handler code to be recorded in the event table. If you don’t see
results immediately, try again in a few seconds.

The query you write will retrieve contextual information about events emitted by the function. That context includes the name of the
function that emitted it.

To query the event table for trace data:

1. Paste and run the following statement to query the event table for trace data.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT
     TIMESTAMP AS time,
     RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES['snow.executable.name'] AS handler_name,
     RECORD['name'] AS event_name,
     RECORD_ATTRIBUTES AS attributes
   FROM
     tutorial_log_trace_db.public.tutorial_event_table
   WHERE
     RECORD_TYPE = 'SPAN_EVENT'
     AND HANDLER_NAME LIKE 'LOG_TRACE_DATA%';
   ```

   Some columns contain structured data expressed as key-value pairs. For these, you can select attribute values within a column by using
   [bracket notation](/user-guide/querying-semistructured#label-bracket-notation-when-querying-semistructured-data), as shown in the code.
2. View the output.

   ```
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | TIME                    | HANDLER_NAME                         | EVENT_NAME              | ATTRIBUTES                                             |
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | 2023-05-10 20:49:35.080 | "LOG_TRACE_DATA():VARCHAR(16777216)" | "event_with_attributes" | { "example.key1": "value1", "example.key2": "value2" } |
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

   The output illustrates how the [event table’s predefined columns](/developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-columns) each
   contain parts of the collected data. For the `EXECUTABLE` and `SEVERITY` values, you’ve used bracket notation
   to specify the attribute whose value you want.

   > | Output Column | Description |
   > | --- | --- |
   > | TIME | Time the entry was created (from the TIMESTAMP column). |
   > | HANDLER\_NAME | UDF name and parameters (from the RESOURCE\_ATTRIBUTES column’s `snow.executable.name` attribute). |
   > | EVENT\_NAME | Name of the event added with the `add_event` function (from the RECORD column’s `name` attribute). |
