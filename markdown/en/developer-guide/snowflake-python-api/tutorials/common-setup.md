# Common setup for Snowflake Python APIs tutorials

## Introduction

This topic provides instructions for the common setup required for all Snowflake Python APIs tutorials available in this documentation.

### Overview of the Snowflake Python APIs

Before starting your setup, take a look at the Snowflake Python APIs structure. The following table lists some common modules in the API:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `snowflake.core` | Defines an iterator to represent certain resource instances fetched from the Snowflake database. |
| `snowflake.core.database` | Manages Snowflake databases. |
| `snowflake.core.schema` | Manages Snowflake schemas. |
| `snowflake.core.table` | Manages Snowflake tables. |
| `snowflake.core.task` | Manages Snowflake tasks. |
| `snowflake.core.task.dagv1` | A set of APIs at a higher level than the task APIs in `snowflake.core.task` to more conveniently manage task graphs (DAGs). |
| `snowflake.core.compute_pool` | Manages compute pools in Snowpark Container Services. |
| `snowflake.core.image_repository` | Manages image repositories in Snowpark Container Services. |
| `snowflake.core.service` | Manages services in Snowpark Container Services. |

For a complete list of the APIs currently available, see the
[API reference documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/reference/latest/index).

The `snowflake.core` module represents the entry point to the core Snowflake Python APIs that manage Snowflake objects. To use the
API, you follow a common pattern:

1. Establish a session using Snowpark or a Python Connector connection, representing your connection to Snowflake.
2. Import and instantiate the `Root` class from `snowflake.core`, and pass the Snowpark session object as an argument.

   You use the resulting `Root` object to access the rest of the methods and types in the API.

For more information about the programming model of the API, see [Snowflake Python APIs: General concepts](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/snowflake-python-general-concepts).

The following code is an example of what this pattern typically looks like:

Copy code

```
from snowflake.snowpark import Session
from snowflake.core import Root

session = Session.builder.config("connection_name", "default").create()
root = Root(session)
```

For more information about various connection options and attributes, see
[Connect to Snowflake with the Snowflake Python APIs](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/snowflake-python-connecting-snowflake).

Note

The Snowflake Python APIs can establish a connection to Snowflake using either a Snowpark session or a Python Connector connection. The
preceding example uses a Snowpark session.

Continue to the next step to start setting up the API and your development environment!

## Install the Snowflake Python APIs

Important

The Snowflake Python APIs currently supports the following versions of Python:

Generally available versions:

- 3.9 (deprecated)
- 3.10
- 3.11
- 3.12
- 3.13
- 3.14

Before installing the API, you need to activate a Python environment.

In this tutorial, you can use conda or a virtual environment (venv).

1. To create and activate a conda or virtual environment, open a command-line terminal and run the following commands:

   condavenv

   Copy code

   ```
   conda create -n <env_name> python==3.10
   conda activate <env_name>
   ```

   Copy code

   ```
   python3 -m venv '.venv'
   source '.venv/bin/activate'
   ```
2. The Snowflake Python APIs package is available in PyPI.

   To install the API package in the new conda or virtual environment, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   pip install snowflake -U
   ```
3. To install the `snowflake-snowpark-python` package, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   pip install 'snowflake-snowpark-python>=1.5.0,<2.0.0'
   ```

   In these tutorials, you use the `snowflake.snowpark.Session` object from the [Snowpark API for Python](/developer-guide/snowpark/python/index)
   to create a connection to Snowflake.

## Set up your development environment

This tutorial walks through code examples that you can run in a Jupyter notebook. Each step in the tutorial incrementally showcases the
capabilities of the Snowflake Python APIs.

You start by setting up your development environment so that you can run the code examples in a notebook.

1. Create a file named `$HOME/.snowflake/connections.toml` with the following connection parameters, and update it with your real
   credentials:

   Copy code

   ```
   [default]
   account = "<YOUR ACCOUNT NAME>"
   user = "<YOUR ACCOUNT USER>"
   password = "<YOUR ACCOUNT USER PASSWORD>"
   # optional
   # warehouse = "<YOUR COMPUTE WH>"
   # optional
   # database = "<YOUR DATABASE>"
   # optional
   # schema = "<YOUR SCHEMA>"
   ```

   Note

   The `account` parameter does not support [account identifiers](/user-guide/admin-account-identifier) with
   underscores. You must specify an account identifier with dashes in place of any underscores. For more information, see
   [Account name in your organization](/user-guide/admin-account-identifier#label-account-name).

   This example specifies these parameters as the default connection to Snowflake in your environment by creating a connection
   definition named `default`.
2. Use one of the following methods to open a notebook:

   - Open a new notebook in a code editor that supports Jupyter notebooks (such as Visual Studio Code).
   - To open a notebook in your browser, start a notebook server with the command `jupyter notebook`.

     To ensure that your environment can run a notebook, run `conda install notebook` in your terminal before starting the
     notebook server.
3. In the first cell of the notebook, run the following import statements:

   Copy code

   ```
   from datetime import timedelta

   from snowflake.snowpark import Session
   from snowflake.snowpark.functions import col
   from snowflake.core import Root, CreateMode
   from snowflake.core.database import Database
   from snowflake.core.schema import Schema
   from snowflake.core.stage import Stage
   from snowflake.core.table import Table, TableColumn, PrimaryKey
   from snowflake.core.task import StoredProcedureCall, Task
   from snowflake.core.task.dagv1 import DAGOperation, DAG, DAGTask
   from snowflake.core.warehouse import Warehouse
   ```

   Note

   After running this cell, you might be prompted to set your Python kernel. If you activated a conda environment, select conda as the
   Python kernel (for example, something similar to: `~/miniconda3/envs/<your conda env>/bin/python`).

   In this cell, you import Snowpark and the core APIs that manage Snowflake objects.
4. To establish a connection to Snowflake, in the next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   session = Session.builder.config("connection_name", "default").create()
   ```

   In this cell, you create a Snowpark session and set the connection parameters for your session by specifying the `connection_name` as
   the `default` connection definition that you previously configured.
5. To create a `Root` object, pass your `session` object to the `Root` constructor:

   Copy code

   ```
   root = Root(session)
   ```

And that’s it! By running the code in these three cells, you’re now ready to use the Snowflake Python APIs.
