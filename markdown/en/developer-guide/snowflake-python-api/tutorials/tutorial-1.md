# Tutorial 1: Create a database, schema, table, and warehouse

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you learn the fundamentals for managing Snowflake resource objects using the Snowflake Python APIs. To get started with the
API, you create and manage a Snowflake database, schema, table, and virtual warehouse.

### Prerequisites

Note

If you have already completed the steps in [Common setup for Snowflake Python APIs tutorials](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/tutorials/common-setup), you can skip these prerequisites and proceed to the first step of this
tutorial.

Before you start this tutorial, you must complete the [common setup](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/tutorials/common-setup) instructions, which includes the following steps:

> - Set up your development environment.
> - Install the Snowflake Python APIs package.
> - Configure your Snowflake connection.
> - Import all the modules required for the Python API tutorials.
> - Create an API `Root` object.

After completing these prerequisites, you are ready to start using the API.

## Create a database, schema, and table

You can use your `root` object to create a database, schema, and table in your Snowflake account.

1. To create a database, in the next cell of your notebook, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   database = root.databases.create(
     Database(
    name="PYTHON_API_DB"),
    mode=CreateMode.or_replace
     )
   ```

   This code, which is functionally equivalent to the SQL command `CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE PYTHON_API_DB`, creates a database in your
   account named `PYTHON_API_DB`. This code follows a common pattern for managing objects in Snowflake:

   - `root.databases.create()` creates a database in Snowflake. It accepts two arguments: a `Database` object and a mode.
   - You pass a `Database` object by using `Database(name="PYTHON_API_DB")`, and set the name of the database by using the
     `name` argument. Recall that you imported `Database` on line 3 of the notebook.
   - You specify the creation mode by passing the `mode` argument. In this case, you set it to `CreateMode.or_replace`, but the
     following values are also valid:

     - `CreateMode.if_not_exists`: Functionally equivalent to CREATE IF NOT EXISTS in SQL.
     - `CreateMode.error_if_exists`: Raises an exception if the object already exists in Snowflake. This is the default value if a
       mode is not specified.
   - You manage the database programmatically by storing a reference to the database in an object you created named `database`.

   For more information, see [Managing Snowflake databases, schemas, tables, and views with Python](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/snowflake-python-managing-databases).
2. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
3. In the navigation menu, select **Catalog** » **Explorer**. If your code was successful, the
   `PYTHON_API_DB` database is listed.

   Tip

   If you use VS Code, install the [Snowflake extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snowflake.snowflake-vsc) to
   explore all Snowflake objects within your editor.
4. To create a schema in the `PYTHON_API_DB` database, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   schema = database.schemas.create(
     Schema(
    name="PYTHON_API_SCHEMA"),
    mode=CreateMode.or_replace,
     )
   ```

   Note that you call `.schemas.create()` on the `database` object you created previously.
5. To create a table in the schema you just created, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   table = schema.tables.create(
     Table(
    name="PYTHON_API_TABLE",
    columns=[
      TableColumn(
        name="TEMPERATURE",
        datatype="int",
        nullable=False,
      ),
      TableColumn(
        name="LOCATION",
        datatype="string",
      ),
    ],
     ),
   mode=CreateMode.or_replace
   )
   ```

   This code creates a table in the `PYTHON_API_SCHEMA` schema with two columns and their data types specified: `TEMPERATURE` as
   `int`, and `LOCATION` as `string`.

   These last two code examples should look familiar because they follow the pattern in the first step where you created the
   `PYTHON_API_DB` database.
6. To confirm that the objects were created, return to your Snowflake account in Snowsight.

## Retrieve object data

You can retrieve metadata about an object in Snowflake.

1. To retrieve details about the `PYTHON_API_TABLE` table you created previously, in your next notebook cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   table_details = table.fetch()
   ```

   `fetch()` returns a `TableModel` object.
2. You can then call `.to_dict()` on the resulting object to view its detailed information.

   To print the table details, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   table_details.to_dict()
   ```

   The notebook should display a dictionary that contains metadata about the `PYTHON_API_TABLE` table, similar to this:

   Copy code

   ```
   {
    "name": "PYTHON_API_TABLE",
    "kind": "TABLE",
    "enable_schema_evolution": False,
    "change_tracking": False,
    "data_retention_time_in_days": 1,
    "max_data_extension_time_in_days": 14,
    "default_ddl_collation": "",
    "columns": [
        {"name": "TEMPERATURE", "datatype": "NUMBER(38,0)", "nullable": False},
        {"name": "LOCATION", "datatype": "VARCHAR(16777216)", "nullable": True},
    ],
    "created_on": datetime.datetime(
        2024, 5, 9, 8, 59, 15, 832000, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc
    ),
    "database_name": "PYTHON_API_DB",
    "schema_name": "PYTHON_API_SCHEMA",
    "rows": 0,
    "bytes": 0,
    "owner": "ACCOUNTADMIN",
    "automatic_clustering": False,
    "search_optimization": False,
    "owner_role_type": "ROLE",
   }
   ```

   As shown, this dictionary contains information about the `PYTHON_API_TABLE` table that you created previously, with detailed
   information about `columns`, `owner`, `database`, `schema`, and more.

Object metadata is useful when you are building business logic in your application. For example, you might build logic that runs depending
on certain information about an object. You can use `fetch()` to retrieve object metadata in such scenarios.

## Programmatically alter a table

You can programmatically add a column to a table. The `PYTHON_API_TABLE` table currently has two columns: `TEMPERATURE` and `LOCATION`.
In this scenario, you want to add a new column named `ELEVATION` of type `int` and set it as the table’s primary key.

1. In your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   table_details.columns.append(
    TableColumn(
      name="elevation",
      datatype="int",
      nullable=False,
      constraints=[PrimaryKey()],
    )
   )
   ```

   Note

   This code does not create the column. Instead, this column definition is appended to the array that represents the table’s columns in
   the `TableModel`. To view this array, review the value of `columns` as described in the instructions for viewing the table
   metadata.
2. To modify the table and add the column, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   table.create_or_alter(table_details)
   ```

   In this line, you call `create_or_alter()` on the object representing `PYTHON_API_TABLE`, and pass the updated value of
   `table_details`. This line adds the `ELEVATION` column to `PYTHON_API_TABLE`.
3. To confirm that the column was added, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   table.fetch().to_dict()
   ```

   The output should look similar to this:

   Copy code

   ```
   {
    "name": "PYTHON_API_TABLE",
    "kind": "TABLE",
    "enable_schema_evolution": False,
    "change_tracking": False,
    "data_retention_time_in_days": 1,
    "max_data_extension_time_in_days": 14,
    "default_ddl_collation": "",
    "columns": [
        {"name": "TEMPERATURE", "datatype": "NUMBER(38,0)", "nullable": False},
        {"name": "LOCATION", "datatype": "VARCHAR(16777216)", "nullable": True},
        {"name": "ELEVATION", "datatype": "NUMBER(38,0)", "nullable": False},
    ],
    "created_on": datetime.datetime(
        2024, 5, 9, 8, 59, 15, 832000, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc
    ),
    "database_name": "PYTHON_API_DB",
    "schema_name": "PYTHON_API_SCHEMA",
    "rows": 0,
    "bytes": 0,
    "owner": "ACCOUNTADMIN",
    "automatic_clustering": False,
    "search_optimization": False,
    "owner_role_type": "ROLE",
    "constraints": [
        {"name": "ELEVATION", "column_names": ["ELEVATION"], "constraint_type": "PRIMARY KEY"}
    ]
   }
   ```

   Review the value of `columns` and the value of `constraints`, both of which now include the `ELEVATION` column.
4. To confirm the existence of the new column, return to your Snowflake account in Snowsight and inspect the table.

## Create and manage a warehouse

You can also manage virtual warehouses with the Snowflake Python APIs. For example, you might need to create another warehouse temporarily to
run certain queries. In this scenario, you can use the API to create, suspend, or drop a warehouse.

1. To retrieve the collection of warehouses associated with your session, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   warehouses = root.warehouses
   ```

   You manage warehouses in your session using the resulting `warehouses` object.
2. To define and create a new warehouse, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   python_api_wh = Warehouse(
    name="PYTHON_API_WH",
    warehouse_size="SMALL",
    auto_suspend=500,
   )

   warehouse = warehouses.create(python_api_wh,mode=CreateMode.or_replace)
   ```

   In this code, you define a new warehouse by instantiating `Warehouse` and specifying the warehouse’s name, size, and auto-suspend
   policy. The auto-suspend timeout is in units of seconds. In this case, the warehouse will be suspended after 8.33 minutes of inactivity.

   You then create the warehouse by calling `create()` on your warehouse collection. You store the reference in the resulting
   `warehouse` object.
3. Navigate to your Snowflake account in Snowsight and confirm that the warehouse was created.
4. To retrieve information about the warehouse, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   warehouse_details = warehouse.fetch()
   warehouse_details.to_dict()
   ```

   This code should look familiar because it follows the same pattern you used to fetch table metadata in a previous step. The output should
   be similar to this:

   Copy code

   ```
   {
     'name': 'PYTHON_API_WH',
     'auto_suspend': 500,
     'auto_resume': 'true',
     'resource_monitor': 'null',
     'comment': '',
     'max_concurrency_level': 8,
     'statement_queued_timeout_in_seconds': 0,
     'statement_timeout_in_seconds': 172800,
     'tags': {},
     'warehouse_type': 'STANDARD',
     'warehouse_size': 'Small'
   }
   ```
5. Optional: If you have multiple warehouses in your session, use the API to iterate through them or to search for a specific warehouse.

   In your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   warehouse_list = warehouses.iter(like="PYTHON_API_WH")
   result = next(warehouse_list)
   result.to_dict()
   ```

   In this code, you call `iter()` on the warehouse collection and pass the `like` argument, which returns any
   warehouses whose names match the specified string. In this case, you pass the name of the warehouse you defined previously, but
   this argument is generally a case-insensitive string that functions as a filter, with support for SQL wildcard characters like `%`
   and `_`.

   After you run the cell, output similar to the following code shows that you successfully returned a matching warehouse:

   Copy code

   ```
   {
     'name': 'PYTHON_API_WH',
     'auto_suspend': 500,
     'auto_resume': 'true',
     'resource_monitor': 'null',
     'comment': '',
     'max_concurrency_level': 8,
     'statement_queued_timeout_in_seconds': 0,
     'statement_timeout_in_seconds': 172800,
     'tags': {},
     'warehouse_type': 'STANDARD',
     'warehouse_size': 'Small'
   }
   ```
6. To programmatically modify the warehouse by changing its size to `LARGE`, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   warehouse = root.warehouses.create(Warehouse(
    name="PYTHON_API_WH",
    warehouse_size="LARGE",
    auto_suspend=500,
   ), mode=CreateMode.or_replace)
   ```
7. To confirm that the warehouse size was updated to `LARGE`, do one of the following:

   - In your next cell, run the following code:

     Copy code

     ```
     warehouse.fetch().size
     ```
   - Navigate to your Snowflake account in Snowsight and confirm the change in warehouse size.
8. Optional: If you don’t want to continue using the warehouse, drop it. In your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   warehouse.drop()
   ```
9. To confirm the warehouse deletion, return to your Snowflake account in Snowsight.
