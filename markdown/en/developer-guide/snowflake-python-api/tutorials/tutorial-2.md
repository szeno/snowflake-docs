# Tutorial 2: Create and manage tasks and task graphs (DAGs)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you create and use Snowflake tasks to manage some basic stored procedures. You also create a task graph — also
called a directed acyclic graph (DAG) — to orchestrate tasks with a higher-level task graph API.

### Prerequisites

Note

If you have already completed both [Common setup for Snowflake Python APIs tutorials](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/tutorials/common-setup) and [Tutorial 1: Create a database, schema, table, and warehouse](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/tutorials/tutorial-1), you can skip these prerequisites and proceed to the first
step of this tutorial.

Before you start this tutorial, you must complete the following steps:

1. Follow the [common setup](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/tutorials/common-setup) instructions, which includes the following steps:

   - Set up your development environment.
   - Install the Snowflake Python APIs package.
   - Configure your Snowflake connection.
   - Import all the modules required for the Python API tutorials.
   - Create an API `Root` object.
2. Run the following code to create a database named `PYTHON_API_DB` and a schema named `PYTHON_API_SCHEMA` in that database.

   Copy code

   ```
   database = root.databases.create(
     Database(
    name="PYTHON_API_DB"),
    mode=CreateMode.or_replace
     )

   schema = database.schemas.create(
     Schema(
    name="PYTHON_API_SCHEMA"),
    mode=CreateMode.or_replace,
     )
   ```

   These are the same database and schema objects you create in [Tutorial 1](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/tutorials/tutorial-1).

After completing these prerequisites, you are ready to start using the API for task management.

## Set up Snowflake objects

Set up the stored procedures that your tasks will invoke and the stage that will hold the stored procedures. You can use your
Snowflake Python APIs `root` object to create a stage in the `PYTHON_API_DB` database and `PYTHON_API_SCHEMA` schema you previously
created.

1. To create a stage named `TASKS_STAGE`, in the next cell of your notebook, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   stages = root.databases[database.name].schemas[schema.name].stages
   stages.create(Stage(name="TASKS_STAGE"))
   ```

   This stage will hold the stored procedures and any dependencies those procedures need.
2. To create two basic Python functions that the tasks will run as stored procedures, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   def trunc(session: Session, from_table: str, to_table: str, count: int) -> str:
     (
    session
    .table(from_table)
    .limit(count)
    .write.save_as_table(to_table)
     )
     return "Truncated table successfully created!"

   def filter_by_shipmode(session: Session, mode: str) -> str:
     (
    session
    .table("snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf100.lineitem")
    .filter(col("L_SHIPMODE") == mode)
    .limit(10)
    .write.save_as_table("filter_table")
     )
     return "Filter table successfully created!"
   ```

   These functions do the following:

   - `trunc()`: Creates a truncated version of an input table.
   - `filter_by_shipmode()`: Filters the `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF100.LINEITEM` table by ship mode, limits the results to 10
     rows, and writes the results in a new table.

     Note

     This function queries the [TPC-H sample data](/user-guide/sample-data-tpch) in the SNOWFLAKE\_SAMPLE\_DATA database. Snowflake
     creates the sample database in new accounts by default. If the database has not been created in your account, see
     [Use the sample database](/user-guide/sample-data-using).

   The functions are intentionally basic and are intended for demonstration purposes.

## Create and manage tasks

Define, create, and manage two tasks that will run your previously created Python functions as stored procedures.

1. To define the two tasks, `task1` and `task2`, in the next cell of your notebook, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   tasks_stage = f"{database.name}.{schema.name}.TASKS_STAGE"

   task1 = Task(
    name="task_python_api_trunc",
    definition=StoredProcedureCall(
      func=trunc,
      stage_location=f"@{tasks_stage}",
      packages=["snowflake-snowpark-python"],
    ),
    warehouse="COMPUTE_WH",
    schedule=timedelta(minutes=1)
   )

   task2 = Task(
    name="task_python_api_filter",
    definition=StoredProcedureCall(
      func=filter_by_shipmode,
      stage_location=f"@{tasks_stage}",
      packages=["snowflake-snowpark-python"],
    ),
    warehouse="COMPUTE_WH"
   )
   ```

   In this code, you specify the following task parameters:

   - For each task, a definition represented by a [StoredProcedureCall](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/reference/latest/_autosummary/snowflake.core.task.StoredProcedureCall#snowflake.core.task.StoredProcedureCall)
     object that includes the following attributes:

     - The callable function to run
     - The stage location where the contents of your Python function and its dependencies are uploaded
     - The stored procedure’s package dependencies
   - A warehouse to run the stored procedure (required when creating a task with a `StoredProcedureCall` object). This tutorial uses
     the `COMPUTE_WH` warehouse that is included with your trial account.
   - A run schedule for the root task, `task1`. The schedule specifies the interval at which to run the task periodically.

   For more information about stored procedures, see [Writing stored procedures with SQL and Python](/developer-guide/stored-procedure/python/procedure-python-overview).
2. To create the two tasks, retrieve a `TaskCollection` object (`tasks`) from your database schema and call `.create()` on
   your task collection:

   Copy code

   ```
   # create the task in the Snowflake database
   tasks = schema.tasks
   trunc_task = tasks.create(task1, mode=CreateMode.or_replace)

   task2.predecessors = [trunc_task.name]
   filter_task = tasks.create(task2, mode=CreateMode.or_replace)
   ```

   In this code example, you also link the tasks by setting `task1` as a predecessor to `task2`, which creates a minimal task graph.
3. To confirm that the two tasks now exist, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   taskiter = tasks.iter()
   for t in taskiter:
    print(t.name)
   ```
4. When you create tasks, they are suspended by default.

   To start a task, call `.resume()` on the task resource object:

   Copy code

   ```
   trunc_task.resume()
   ```
5. To confirm that the `trunc_task` task was started, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   taskiter = tasks.iter()
   for t in taskiter:
    print("Name: ", t.name, "| State: ", t.state)
   ```

   The output should be similar to this:

   ```
   Name:  TASK_PYTHON_API_FILTER | State:  suspended
   Name:  TASK_PYTHON_API_TRUNC | State:  started
   ```

   You can repeat this step whenever you want to confirm the status of the tasks.
6. To clean up your task resources, you first suspend the task before dropping it.

   In your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   trunc_task.suspend()
   ```
7. To confirm that the task is suspended, repeat step 5.
8. Optional: To drop both tasks, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   trunc_task.drop()
   filter_task.drop()
   ```

## Create and manage a task graph

When you’re coordinating the execution of a large number of tasks, individually managing each task can be a challenge.
The Snowflake Python APIs provides functionality to orchestrate tasks with a higher-level task graph API.

A task graph, which is also called a directed acyclic graph (DAG), is a series of tasks composed of a root task and child tasks,
organized by their dependencies. For more information, see [Create a sequence of tasks with a task graph](/user-guide/tasks-graphs#label-task-dag).

1. To create and deploy a task graph, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   dag_name = "python_api_dag"
   dag = DAG(name=dag_name, schedule=timedelta(days=1))
   with dag:
    dag_task1 = DAGTask(
        name="task_python_api_trunc",
        definition=StoredProcedureCall(
            func=trunc,
            stage_location=f"@{tasks_stage}",
            packages=["snowflake-snowpark-python"]),
        warehouse="COMPUTE_WH",
    )
    dag_task2 = DAGTask(
        name="task_python_api_filter",
        definition=StoredProcedureCall(
            func=filter_by_shipmode,
            stage_location=f"@{tasks_stage}",
            packages=["snowflake-snowpark-python"]),
        warehouse="COMPUTE_WH",
    )
    dag_task1 >> dag_task2
   dag_op = DAGOperation(schema)
   dag_op.deploy(dag, mode=CreateMode.or_replace)
   ```

   In this code, you do the following:

   - Create a task graph object by calling the `DAG` constructor and specifying a name and schedule.
   - Define task graph–specific tasks using the `DAGTask` constructor. Note that the constructor accepts the same arguments that you
     specified for the `StoredProcedureCall` class in a previous step.
   - Specify `dag_task1` as the root task and predecessor to `dag_task2` with more convenient syntax.
   - Deploy the task graph to the `PYTHON_API_SCHEMA` schema of the `PYTHON_API_DB` database.
2. To confirm the creation of the task graph, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   taskiter = tasks.iter()
   for t in taskiter:
    print("Name: ", t.name, "| State: ", t.state)
   ```

   You can repeat this step whenever you want to confirm the status of the tasks.
3. To start the task graph by starting the root task, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   dag_op.run(dag)
   ```
4. To confirm that the `PYTHON_API_DAG$TASK_PYTHON_API_TRUNC` task started, repeat step 2.

   Note

   The function call invoked by the task graph will not succeed because you are not calling it with any of its required arguments.
   The purpose of this step is only to demonstrate how to programmatically start the task graph.
5. To drop the task graph, in your next cell, run the following code:

   Copy code

   ```
   dag_op.drop(dag)
   ```
6. Clean up the database object that you created in these tutorials:

   Copy code

   ```
   database.drop()
   ```
