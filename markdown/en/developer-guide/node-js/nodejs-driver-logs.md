# Configuring log levels and files

The Node.js driver supports two types of loggers to track activity:

- Browser logger, which stores logs in an in-memory buffer within the browser.
- Node logger, which by default, stores logs in a `snowflake.log` file and displays them in the console.

You can use the following code to switch from the browser logger to the node logger. This example switches to the node logger and sends messages to the console.

Copy code

```
Logger.setInstance(new NodeLogger({ logFilePath: 'STDOUT'}));
```

## Supported log levels

The Node.js driver supports the following log levels:

- OFF
- ERROR
- WARNING
- INFO
- DEBUG
- TRACE

## Configure the default logging behavior

You can configure standard logging by calling `snowflake.configure`, similar to the following:

Copy code

```
import snowflake from 'snowflake-sdk';

snowflake.configure({
  logLevel: 'INFO',
  logFilePath: '/some/path/log_file.log',
  additionalLogToConsole: false
});
```

where:

- `logLevel` is the desired [logging level](#label-nodejs-easy-logging-levels).
- `logFilePath` is the location of the log file or `STDOUT` for console output.
- `additionalLogToConsole` is a Boolean value that indicates whether to send log messages also to the console when a `logFilePath` is specified. Default: `true`.

## Use easy logging while debugging your code

When debugging an application, increasing the log level can provide more granular information about what the application is doing.
The Easy Logging feature simplifies debugging by letting you change the log level and the log file destination using a configuration file (default: `sf_client_config.json`).

You typically change log levels only when debugging your application.

This configuration file uses JSON to define the `log_level` and `log_path` logging parameters, as follows:

Copy code

```
{
  "common": {
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "log_path": "/some-path/some-directory"
  }
}
```

where:

- `log_level` is the desired [logging level](#label-nodejs-easy-logging-levels).
- `log_path` is the location to store the log files. The driver automatically creates a `nodejs` sub-directory in the specified `log_path`. For example, if you set `log_path` to `/Users/me/logs`, the drivers creates the `/Users/me/logs/nodejs` directory and stores the logs there.

The driver looks for the location of the configuration file in the following order:

- `clientConfigFile` connection parameter, containing the full path to the configuration file, such as the following:

  Copy code

  ```
  import snowflake from 'snowflake-sdk';

  const connection = snowflake.createConnection({
    account: account,
    username: user,
    password: password,
    application: application,
    clientConfigFile: '/some/path/client_config.json'
  });
  ```
- `SF_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable, containing the full path to the configuration file (for example, `export SF_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE=/some_path/some-directory/client_config.json`).
- Node.js driver installation directory, where the file must be named `sf_client_config.json`.
- User’s home directory, where the file must be named `sf_client_config.json`.

Note

To enhance security, the driver requires the logging configuration file on Unix-style systems to limit file permissions to allow only the file owner to modify the files (such as `chmod 0600` or `chmod 0644`).

To minimize the number of searches for a configuration file, the driver reads the configuration file only:

- for the first connection.
- for the first connection using the `clientConfigFile` parameter.
