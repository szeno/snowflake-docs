# PHP PDO Driver for Snowflake

Note

This driver currently does not support GCP regional endpoints. Please ensure that any workloads using through this driver do not require support for regional endpoints on GCP. If you have questions about this, please contact Snowflake Support.

The PHP PDO driver for Snowflake provides an interface for developing PHP applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform
all standard operations.

For a list of the operating systems supported by Snowflake clients, see [Operating system support](/release-notes/requirements#label-client-operating-system-support).

For instructions on installing and using the driver, see the GitHub
[PHP PDO Driver for Snowflake repository](https://github.com/snowflakedb/pdo_snowflake) in GitHub.

## Verifying the network connection to Snowflake with SnowCD

After configuring your driver, you can evaluate and troubleshoot your network connectivity to Snowflake using [SnowCD](/user-guide/snowcd).

You can use SnowCD during the initial configuration process and on-demand at any time to evaluate and troubleshoot your network connection to Snowflake.

Important

Beginning with Snowflake version 8.24, network administrators have the option to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all connections to Snowflake. If your administrator decides to enable this feature, you must configure your client or driver to use MFA when connecting to Snowflake. For more information, see the following resources:
