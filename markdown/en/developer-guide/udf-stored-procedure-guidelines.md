# Design Guidelines and Constraints for Functions and Procedures

This topic describes constraints and guidelines to keep in mind when writing UDFs and stored procedures.

[Keeping handler code in-line or on a stage](/developer-guide/inline-or-staged)
:   Choose whether to have your handler code in-line or packaged in a separate file.

[Designing Handlers that Stay Within Snowflake-Imposed Constraints](/developer-guide/udf-stored-procedure-constraints)
:   Ensure stability within the Snowflake environment by developing within constraints described in this topic.

[Naming and overloading procedures and UDFs](/developer-guide/udf-stored-procedure-naming-conventions)
:   Learn the rules for naming and overloading procedures and UDFs.

[Defining arguments for UDFs and stored procedures](/developer-guide/udf-stored-procedure-arguments)
:   Specify the arguments for your procedures and UDFs.

[Data Type Mappings Between SQL and Handler Languages](/developer-guide/udf-stored-procedure-data-type-mapping)
:   Choose the best data types for argument and return values in handler code.

[Making dependencies available to your code](/developer-guide/upload-dependencies)
:   Make your handler or its dependencies available for use at runtime on Snowflake.

## Security

[Security Practices for UDFs and Procedures](/developer-guide/udf-stored-procedure-security-practices)
:   Help your handler code execute securely using these best practices.

[Protecting Sensitive Information with Secure UDFs and Stored Procedures](/developer-guide/secure-udf-procedure)
:   Ensure that sensitive information is concealed from users who should not have access to it.

[Pushdown Optimization and Data Visibility](/developer-guide/pushdown-optimization)
:   Learn about the pushdown optimization that makes queries more efficient, but which can also expose data that you might not want to be
    visible.
