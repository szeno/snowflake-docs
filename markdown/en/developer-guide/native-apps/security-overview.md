# Security requirements and guidelines for a Snowflake Native App

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see
[Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](/developer-guide/native-apps/limitations#label-native-apps-supported-clouds).

This topic provides an overview of the security requirements and guidelines
when developing a Snowflake Native App. It also provides general information about automated
security scan and review process when publishing an app to consumers.

Caution

It is your responsibility to ensure that no personal data, sensitive data,
export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered into any files included
in your application package.

## Overview of Snowflake Native App security requirements

The Snowflake Native App Framework provides security requirements and best practices that providers must follow when
developing a Snowflake Native App. For security requirements and best practices for an app, see
[Security requirements and best practices for a Snowflake Native App](/developer-guide/native-apps/security-app-requirements). For security requirements for an app with containers, see
[Secure a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services](/developer-guide/native-apps/security-na-spcs).

To publish an app to consumers, either as a private listing or on Snowflake Marketplace,
Snowflake implements a security review process that requires a security scan of the components
of an app. If an app does not pass the automated security review, a manual review occurs.

All apps that are published to consumers must pass this security review.

## Potential security risks

The following are some of the possible security risks that can occur when running an app:

- Data exfiltration:

  Malicious apps could copy consumer data to external functions or logs.
- Compute abuse:

  Apps could perform unauthorized tasks, such as cryptomining, at the consumer’s expense.
- Ransomware

  Apps could encrypt or corrupt consumer data, demanding payment for restoration.
- Privilege escalation:

  Apps could attempt to gain unauthorized permissions within the consumer’s account.

To mitigate these and other possible security risks, the Snowflake Native App Framework uses a security review to evaluate
an app for security risks and to ensure security best practices.

## Automated security reviews

To mitigate potential security risks, Snowflake uses the Native App Anti-Abuse Pipeline Service (NAAAPS).
This service automatically scans all new app versions using various tools to determine if an app can
be distributed to consumers.

This automated security review occurs when a new version or patch of an app is created. This review
performs the following:

- Copies the app to a dedicated Snowflake account used to scan apps.
- Scans the files associated with the app and updates the security review status.
- Auto-approves the app or initiates a manual review of the app.

During the manual review process, an app can be approved or rejected. Snowflake does not send a notification if an
app is rejected. Providers can [view the status of the review](/developer-guide/native-apps/security-run-scan#label-native-apps-view-scan-status) in
Snowsight.

## Scanners and tools used during a security review

The automated security review uses the following scanners and tools to perform the
following to analyze different components of an app:

- Scan code for bugs, anti-patterns, and security vulnerabilities in code.
- Scan code for malware.
- Identify vulnerabilities in app dependencies.

The processes help detect various security issues, such as data exfiltration, ransomware, compute
abuse, privilege escalation, and dynamic code execution.

## Security requirements and best practices for an app

All apps must conform to the security requirements outlined in the [Security requirements and best practices for a Snowflake Native App](/developer-guide/native-apps/security-app-requirements).

Note

Security requirements are subject to change as Snowflake continues to monitor new potential risks.

## Security considerations for a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services

For information about additional security requirements for a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services see
[Secure a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services](/developer-guide/native-apps/security-na-spcs).

## Guidelines for publishing an app to Snowflake Marketplace

When publishing an app to Snowflake Marketplace, providers must consider additional requirements
and best practices. See [Guidelines and requirements for listing Apps on Snowflake Marketplace](/collaboration/guidelines-reqs-for-listing-apps).

## CVE evaluation criteria for an app

Snowflake’s approach to addressing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in a Snowflake Native App
is based on our CVE Evaluation Criteria, a policy that establishes clear and objective criteria
for evaluating and prioritizing CVEs based on their risk profile.

The policy aims to balance the mitigation of critical security risks with the effort required to
address less severe vulnerabilities. It applies to all apps undergoing security review
and is enforced to ensure only apps meeting the defined criteria are approved for publishing
in Snowflake’s data cloud environment.

See [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) considerations](/developer-guide/native-apps/security-cve) for additional information.

## Scanning Regions

When configuring a Snowflake Native App to be shared externally, providers automatically share the code in app
with Snowflake for scanning. The following table maps the NAAAPS scanning regions to the corresponding
provider regions:
