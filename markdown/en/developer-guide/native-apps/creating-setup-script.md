# Create the setup script

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see
[Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](/developer-guide/native-apps/limitations#label-native-apps-supported-clouds).

This topic describes how to use the setup script to create objects in the app when
running the [CREATE APPLICATION](/sql-reference/sql/create-application) command.

It also describes application roles and how they are used within the setup script.

## About the setup script

The setup script contains SQL statements that are run in one of the following contexts:

- A consumer installs or upgrades a Snowflake Native App.
- A provider creates or upgrades an app when testing the application package.

Note

The setup script only supports using SQL commands. Other languages are not supported.

The SQL statements in the setup script create objects within the app that are
required by the app. This includes database objects, stored procedures, views, and
[application roles](#label-native-apps-app-roles-about).

The manifest file specifies the filename and relative path to the setup script. The setup
script must exist on a named stage and be accessible by the app package.

## Restrictions on the setup script

The following cannot be performed within a setup script:

- [USE DATABASE](/sql-reference/sql/use-database)
- [USE SCHEMA](/sql-reference/sql/use-schema)
- [USE ROLE](/sql-reference/sql/use-role)
- [USE SECONDARY ROLES](/sql-reference/sql/use-secondary-roles)
- Only certain object types support setting the LOG\_LEVEL, TRACE\_LEVEL, METRIC\_LEVEL, and
  LOG\_EVENT\_LEVEL properties using the [ALTER <object>](/sql-reference/sql/alter) command. For a list of
  supported object types, see [Set the log and trace levels for an app](/developer-guide/native-apps/event-definition#label-nativeapps-provider-logging-configure).
- Creating or invoking procedures that are EXECUTE AS CALLER.
- Creating Snowpark user-defined functions (UDFs) or procedures that use IMPORT to include files
  on a named stage.
- Calling procedures, functions, or anonymous code blocks that refer to code not included in the
  application package.
- Importing code files from a named stage when using the [CREATE FUNCTION](/sql-reference/sql/create-function)
  command.
- Using [CALL](/sql-reference/sql/call) to call a procedure that runs as EXECUTE AS CALLER.

There are additional restrictions on objects created within a versioned schema.

## Visibility of objects created in the setup script

The setup script can create most types of database-level objects. Database objects created by
the setup script are internal to the app. When a consumer installs an app, by default,
these objects are invisible and inaccessible to the consumer account directly.

Note

Providers can access objects created by the setup script by using development mode when
testing an application package. See [Use development, debug, and session debug modes to test an app](/developer-guide/native-apps/installing-testing-application#label-native-apps-dev-mode) for more information.

A provider can make these objects visible to the consumer using application roles. An application
role created within the setup script is automatically granted to the role owning the app.

Users that have been granted a role that owns the application object can grant application roles to other
roles within their account. For example, the setup script can define an application
role, such as APP\_ADMIN, and this role can grant permission to access objects within the app.

## Set the log level for messages output by the setup script

A provider can specify the log level for messages generated when the setup script runs. See
[Logging messages in Snowflake Scripting](/developer-guide/logging-tracing/logging-snowflake-scripting) for additional information.

To configure the log level for the setup script, use one of the following system functions:

- [SYSTEM$LOG](/sql-reference/functions/system_log)
- [SYSTEM$LOG\_<level>](/sql-reference/functions/system_log)

For example, to configure the setup script to log error messages, add the following command at
the beginning of the setup script:

Copy code

```
SYSTEM$LOG('error', 'Error message');
```

## Create modular setup scripts

The setup script of a typical app can be large and complex. To make the setup script more modular
and easier to maintain, a provider can create a primary setup script that calls multiple secondary
setup scripts.

For example, a provider can create different setup scripts to handle different types of tasks, for
example, creating objects, creating views, creating stored procedures, and so on.

When the [CREATE APPLICATION](/sql-reference/sql/create-application) command runs, it runs the main setup script
specified in the manifest file. To run additional setup scripts from the main setup script,
use the [EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM](/sql-reference/sql/execute-immediate-from) command.

Setup scripts included in the primary setup script are run in the order they are
encountered. These secondary setup scripts can also include instances of the
[EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM](/sql-reference/sql/execute-immediate-from) command.

### Add multiple setup scripts to an app

1. Add the location of the primary setup script to the manifest file.

   Copy code

   ```
   artifacts:
     ...
      setup_script: scripts/setup_script.sql
     ...
   ```
2. Create the primary setup script.

   The following example shows a typical directory structure for an app:

   Copy code

   ```
   @test.schema1.stage1:
   └── /
    ├── manifest.yml
    ├── readme.md
    ├── scripts/setup_script.sql
   ```

   Where `setup_script.sql` is the primary setup script.
3. Create the secondary setup scripts.

   The following example shows a typical directory structure for an app containing
   multiple setup scripts:

   Copy code

   ```
   @test.schema1.stage1:
   └── /
    ├── manifest.yml
    ├── readme.md
    ├── scripts/setup_script.sql
    ├── scripts/secondary_script.sql
    ├── scripts/procs/setup_procs.sql
    ├── scripts/views/setup_views.sql
    ├── scripts/data/setup_data.sql
   ```
4. Within the primary setup script, use the [EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM](/sql-reference/sql/execute-immediate-from)
   command to specify a relative path to each secondary setup script:

   Copy code

   ```
   ...
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM 'secondary_script.sql';
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM './procs/setup_procs.sql';
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM '../scripts/views/setup_views.sql';
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM '/scripts/data/setup_data.sql';
   ...
   ```

   The path provided to the [EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM](/sql-reference/sql/execute-immediate-from) command
   is case-sensitive and it can be used with any setup script. Use a forward slash (`/`) to
   indicate the relative path of the app root directory, use a period and a forward slash (`./`)
   to indicate the current directory for the setup script, and use two periods and a forward slash (`../`)
   to indicate the parent directory for the setup script.

   A primary setup script is the script defined in the manifest. The [EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM](/sql-reference/sql/execute-immediate-from)
   command can be used with any setup script.

### Limitations on using EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM in a setup script

The following limitations apply when using [EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM](/sql-reference/sql/execute-immediate-from) within
a setup script:

- Event logging is not supported in setup scripts called using [EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM](/sql-reference/sql/execute-immediate-from).
- Accessing files stored on encrypted external stages in the consumer account is not supported.
- During app runtime, only the relative path format with a forward slash (`/`) is permitted. For example,
  `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM '/scripts/data/setup_data.sql'`.

## Best practices when creating the setup script

Snowflake recommends the following best practices when creating the setup script for an app.

### Use idempotent forms of CREATE statements

When using a CREATE command to create objects within the setup script, Snowflake recommends using the
following versions of these commands:

- CREATE OR REPLACE
- CREATE IF NOT EXISTS

The setup script can be run multiple times during installation and upgrade. In cases where an error occurs,
these objects might already exist, especially if they are created within a versioned schema.

### Include the target schema when creating objects

The [CREATE SCHEMA](/sql-reference/sql/create-schema) command does not change the session context. Objects must be
qualified with the target schema when they are created. For example, to create a schema within the setup
script, use the following commands:

Copy code

```
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS app_config;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app_config.params(...);
```

### Do not refer to objects in the app from outside the app

Do not create objects outside the app that refer to objects within the app. Although the Snowflake Native App Framework
does not prohibit creating these objects, it can lead to problems when a consumer installs the Snowflake Native App.

For example, consider the context where a setup script creates a database, schema, and view outside
of the app and the view refers to a table within the app. In this context, the view in the database breaks when the
consumer takes ownership of the database and drops the app.

This best practice applies to tables, stored procedures, user-defined functions, and references created
by the setup script.

### Account for possible failures when using versioned or non-versioned schemas

Objects in a versioned schema can refer to objects in a non-versioned schema and vice versa. The setup
script must account for what might happen in case of failure during installation or upgrade. For example,
a provider must account for what happens if the setup script automatically runs again if the initial
run fails.

For example, consider creating objects using the following:

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE app_state.proc()...;
GRANT USAGE ON PROCEDURE app_state.proc()
  TO APPLICATION ROLE app_user;
```

In this example, the CREATE OR REPLACE statement replaces an existing procedure, which implicitly
removes privileges that had been previously granted to that procedure. Although the grants might be
restored later in the script, if the script fails when it is run, consumers might lose the ability to access
the procedure.

If a setup script fails due to an issue that cannot be resolved by retrying, for example a
syntax error, the consumer cannot access the procedure until the app is upgraded to a new version or patch
and the grant is restored.

Caution

The guidance in this section does not apply to [tags](/user-guide/object-tagging/introduction),
[masking policies](/user-guide/security-column-intro), and [row access policies](/user-guide/security-row-intro) outside the
context of the Snowflake Native App Framework.

Tag and policy assignments do not propagate to incremental versions of a versioned schema. These scenarios trigger an error message
(using a tag as an example):

- Create a tag in the versioned schema and assign the tag to an object in a different schema.
- Create a tag in a non-versioned schema and assign the tag to an object in a versioned schema.
- Create tables or views in the versioned schema and assign a tag to the tables or views when the tag exists in a non-versioned schema.
- Create tables or views in a non-versioned schema and assign a tag to the tables or views when the tag exists in a versioned schema.

The error message is:

```
A TAG in a versioned schema can only be assigned to the objects in the same schema. An object in a versioned schema can only have a TAG assigned that is defined in the same schema.
```

If the policy assignment triggers the error message, the error message specifies `POLICY` instead of `TAG`.

To prevent the error message:

- The Snowflake Native App provider should update the setup script to ensure that tags (or policies) are set on objects within the
  same schema as the tag when a versioned schema contains either the tag or the object on which the tag is set. If a non-versioned
  schema contains either the tag or the object on which the tag is set, it is not necessary to update the setup script.
- If the Snowflake Native App consumer sees this error message when installing an app, the consumer should ask the provider to update
  their setup script. Additionally, the consumer should not assign any tag that exists in a versioned schema to any object in their
  account, such as a warehouse, or assign a policy that exists in a versioned schema to a table or column, or assign a policy or tag to
  an object that exists in a versioned schema inside the Snowflake Native App. If so, Snowflake returns the same error message.

### Define views within a versioned schema

Always define views on shared content in a versioned schema to ensure that any code
accessing the view during an upgrade uses a consistent view. You should also use a versioned
schema when adding or removing new columns or other attributes.

### Ensure time-consuming operations are compatible

If the setup script must perform very long-running operations, such as upgrading large state tables,
ensure that these updates are compatible with existing running code from the previous version.

## About application roles

By default, the consumer has no privileges on objects created within the app. Even the ACCOUNTADMIN role
cannot view the objects **within** an app. Objects that the app creates outside itself,
such as a database, are visible only to the ACCOUNTADMIN role of the consumer account.

Application roles are similar to database roles, but may only be created within the app. Unlike database
roles, application roles can be granted privileges on objects that exist outside of the app.

Application roles should be created by the setup script when the app is installed and are automatically granted
to the app owner’s role, which then can grant appropriate application roles to other roles in the consumer account.

Note

Application roles are the only type of role that can be created within an app. Database
roles, for example, are not permitted within the app.

Likewise, application roles can only be created in an app and not, for example, in a normal
database or at the account level.

Any privileges granted to application roles are passed to the app owner, which is the role used to install
the app. The owner may further delegate application roles to other roles within the consumer
account.

The setup script can also define an application role (for example, USER). Using this role, consumers
are granted access to use the functionality provided by the app. The setup script
can define an application role, such as READ\_ONLY, to provide restricted access to select
areas of data within the app.

Unlike database roles, application roles may also be granted privileges on objects outside
of the installed app. They may therefore be used to grant privileges on objects
outside of the app. However, the application role itself must be created within the app.

## Supported SQL commands for working with application roles

The Snowflake Native App Framework provides the following SQL commands for working with application roles:

- [ALTER APPLICATION ROLE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-application-role)
- [CREATE APPLICATION ROLE](/sql-reference/sql/create-application-role)
- [DROP APPLICATION ROLE](/sql-reference/sql/drop-application-role)
- [GRANT APPLICATION ROLE](/sql-reference/sql/grant-application-role)
- [REVOKE APPLICATION ROLE](/sql-reference/sql/revoke-application-role)
- [SHOW APPLICATION ROLES](/sql-reference/sql/show-application-roles)

## Using application roles in the setup script

Application roles defined in the setup script are automatically granted to the role owning
the app instance. When the app is installed, the role used to install the app is the owner of the app.
However, the app owner can grant privileges to other account roles in the consumer account.

Application roles allow privileges on objects within the app to be granted to the consumer. For example:

Copy code

```
CREATE APPLICATION ROLE admin;
CREATE APPLICATION ROLE user;
GRANT APPLICATION ROLE user TO APPLICATION ROLE admin;

CREATE OR ALTER VERSIONED SCHEMA app_code;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA app_code TO APPLICATION ROLE admin;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA app_code TO APPLICATION ROLE user;
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE app_code.config_app(...)
GRANT USAGE ON PROCEDURE app_code.config_app(...)
  TO APPLICATION ROLE admin;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION app_code.add(x INT, y INT)
GRANT USAGE ON FUNCTION app_code.add(INT, INT)
  TO APPLICATION ROLE admin;
GRANT USAGE ON FUNCTION app_code.add(INT, INT)
  TO APPLICATION ROLE user;
```

In this example, the setup script creates application roles named `admin` and `user`. The setup
script then grants both application roles access to the schema containing the app code. It also grants
access to the `add` function within the schema. The `admin` role is also granted access to the
`config_app` procedure.

## Application roles and versions

Application roles are not versioned. This means that dropping an application role or revoking a
permission from an object that is not in a versioned schema can impact the current version of an
application or the version being upgraded. Application roles may only be safely dropped when you have
dropped all versions of the app that use those roles.

Note

Application roles cannot be granted ownership of objects. This means that an application role
defined in the setup script should only be used to allow consumers to access objects within the installed
Snowflake Native App.
