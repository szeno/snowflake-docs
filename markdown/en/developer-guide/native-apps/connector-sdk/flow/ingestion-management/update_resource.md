# Update resource

Updating a resource is used to redefine ingestion configurations for a particular resource.
`PUBLIC.UPDATE_RESOURCE` procedure is the entry point from the UI or worksheet to update a resource.

Calling this procedure requires the user has been assigned the `ADMIN` application role.

The resource updating process consists of several phases. Several of which are customizable but include reasonable defaults.
Phases are:

1. Initial validation
2. Custom validation
3. Custom logic before a resource is updated
4. Update of ingestion configurations
5. Finishing ingestion processes for removed ingestion configurations
6. Scheduling ingestion processes for new ingestion configuration
7. Custom logic after a resource is updated and ingestion processes are managed

## Initial validation

Initial validation is performed at the very beginning of the resource update process. It checks:

- whether given input data represent a valid resource ingestion configuration object
- whether a resource with given `id` and `resourceId` exists

## Custom validation

Custom validation is executed just after initial validation.
It is a part of the process which is designed to be customized with the connector-specific logic.

By default, it invokes `PUBLIC.UPDATE_RESOURCE_VALIDATE(resource_ingestion_definition_id VARCHAR, ingestion_configurations VARIANT)`,
which returns `'response_code': 'OK'`. It can be overwritten through the SQL script or by using
a `UpdateResourceHandlerBuilder` to provide custom implementation of the `UpdateResourceValidator` interface.

If the custom validation returns error, the next steps will not be executed and given error response will be returned from `UPDATE_RESOURCE` procedure.

## Custom logic before a resource is updated

Custom logic can be defined and executed before a resource is updated and rescheduled.

By default, it invokes `PUBLIC.PRE_UPDATE_RESOURCE(resource_ingestion_definition_id VARCHAR, ingestion_configurations VARIANT)`,
which returns `'response_code': 'OK'`. It can be overwritten through the SQL script or by using
a `UpdateResourceHandlerBuilder` to provide custom implementation of the `PreUpdateResourceCallback` interface.

If custom logic returns error, the next steps will not be executed and given error response will be returned from `UPDATE_RESOURCE` procedure.

## Update of resource ingestion configurations

Within this step a new ingestion configurations are saved to `STATE.RESOURCE_INGESTION_DEFINITION` table for the resource
with a given `resource_ingestion_definition_id`.

## Finishing ingestion processes for removed ingestion configurations

In this step, when a resource is enabled (`enabled` parameter equals `true`) all active ingestion processes (with
statuses `SCHEDULED` or `IN_PROGRESS`) with ingestion configurations that ids aren’t included in the set of updated ingestion
configurations are finished, which means that their status is switched to `FINISHED`.

## Scheduling ingestion processes for new ingestion configuration

In this step, when a resource is enabled (`enabled` parameter equals `true`) new ingestion processes are created for
updated ingestion configurations that didn’t exist in a previous ingestion configurations state for a given resource.

## Custom logic after a resource is updated

Custom logic can be implemented and executed after resource ingestion configurations are updated.

By default, it invokes `PUBLIC.POST_UPDATE_RESOURCE(resource_ingestion_definition_id VARCHAR, ingestion_configurations VARIANT)`,
which returns `'response_code': 'OK'`. It can be overwritten through the SQL script or by using
a `UpdateResourceHandlerBuilder` to provide custom implementation of the `PostUpdateResourceCallback` interface.

If custom logic returns an error, the given error response will be returned from `UPDATE_RESOURCE` procedure but the
update of resource ingestion definition and ingestion processes will not be rolled back so if required, it should be
handled by the custom implementation.

## Response

### Successful response

On success the procedure returns a result resembling:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "response_code": "OK",
>   "message": "Resource successfully updated."
> }
> ```

### Error response

On error a response resembling the following is returned:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "response_code": "<ERROR_CODE>",
>   "message": "<error message>"
> }
> ```

Possible error codes include:

- `INVALID_INPUT` - Provided procedure’s arguments are invalid and it is not possible to update resource ingestion configurations or a resource with given does not exists.
- `UPDATE_RESOURCE_ERROR` - Something unexpected happened when updating the resource ingestion definition with new ingestion configurations or when managing ingestion processes. All changes are rolled back.
