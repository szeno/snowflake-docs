# Add a compute pool to an app with containers

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see
[Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](/developer-guide/native-apps/limitations#label-native-apps-supported-clouds).

This topic describes how to use compute pools in a Snowflake Native Apps with Snowpark Container Services.

## About compute pools in apps with containers

A [compute pool](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-compute-pool) is a
collection of one or more virtual machine (VM) nodes on which Snowflake runs Snowpark Container Services.
Apps with containers use a compute pool in the consumer account to manage the container images required by
the app.

An app can create multiple compute pools and each compute pool is exclusive to the app. Compute pools
used by the app cannot be used for other purposes.

Containers within an app can directly access each other, even if they are in different compute pools.

However, using different compute pools allows providers to separate types of services. For example, a
provider can separate their frontend services from backend services.

Compute pools are account-level objects, meaning the name of each compute pool must be unique within
the consumer account.

## Best practices for using compute pools in an app with containers

Providers should consider the following best practices when creating compute pools in a consumer account:

- Compute pools have cost implications. It is important to set values for the `min_nodes`,
  `max_nodes`, and `instance_family` properties to consume the correct amount of resources.
  Providers should also set the AUTO\_SUSPEND\_SECS property to automatically suspend inactive compute pools.

  See [CREATE COMPUTE POOL](/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool) for more information.
- Compute pools are account-level objects, as such their pool names must be unique within a consumer account.
  Consider using the application name as a prefix of the compute pool name to ensure uniqueness.
- When adding a compute pool to an app with containers that is installed on different cloud service
  providers, the code used to create the compute pool must account for differences in the instance
  families across different cloud service providers. For example, the `HIGHMEM_X64_L` instance family
  has a different configuration for each cloud service provider.

  See [CREATE COMPUTE POOL](/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool) for more information on available
  instance families. See [Choose different instance families for each provider](#label-native-apps-container-choose-inst-fam) for an example of
  how to set the instance family for different cloud service providers.
- Set the `uses_gpu` property to TRUE only if the app with containers uses a GPU as the
  instance family of the compute pool. See [Set the property in the manifest file](#label-native-apps-container-uses-gpu) for more
  information.

## Create a compute pool for an app

There are two ways to create a compute pool for an app with containers:

- The app creates the compute pools required during installation. This requires that the
  consumer grants the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege on the compute pool to the app. A
  provider can configure the app to request these privileges using Snowsight.

  See [Configure an app to request the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege](#label-native-apps-cont-req-compute-pool) for more information.
- The consumer manually creates the compute pools required by the app. The consumer
  must run the [CREATE COMPUTE POOL](/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool) to create the compute pool, then
  manually grant the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege on the compute pool to the app.

## Set the `uses_gpu` property in the manifest file

If an app with containers specifies a GPU as the instance family for the compute pool, providers
must set the `uses_gpu` flag to `true` in the manifest. The following example
shows how to set this flag in the `artifacts` block:

Copy code

```
artifacts:
  readme: readme.md
  setup_script: scripts/setup.sql
  container_services:
    uses_gpu: true|false
    images:
    - /provider_db/provider_schema/provider_repo/server:prod
    - /provider_db/provider_schema/provider_repo/web:1.0
```

The automated security scan uses this flag security scanning framework to validate behavior during the app version scanning process.

Caution

To publish an app with containers on the Snowflake Marketplace, the app must create
the required compute pools during installation. See [Enforced requirements](/developer-guide/native-apps/publish-guidelines#label-native-apps-marketplace-guidelines)
for the Snowflake Marketplace publication requirements.

## Configure an app to request the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege

Providers can configure an app to request the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege. They can
also create the compute pool from the setup script when the app is installed or upgraded.

Note

An app can create a maximum of five compute pools in a consumer account. Contact Snowflake support
if your app needs to create additional compute pools.

### Request the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege

An app can request the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege from a consumer. This privilege allows the app
to create a compute pool in the consumer account.
See [Request global privileges from consumers](/developer-guide/native-apps/requesting-privs)
for general information about requesting global privileges from the consumer.

To request the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege from a consumer, add the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege to
the manifest file as shown in the following example:

Copy code

```
...
privileges:
 - CREATE COMPUTE POOL
   description: "Enable application to create one to five compute pools"
 ...
```

See [Create the manifest file for an app](/developer-guide/native-apps/manifest-overview) for more information on creating the manifest file for an app with containers.

Note

The behavior for the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege request within a container
app is different than other privilege requests. When you add this privilege to the manifest file, Snowsight displays an interface that allows a consumer
to grant the required privileges.

### Add the CREATE COMPUTE POOL command to the setup script

To create a compute pool in the consumer account add the
[CREATE COMPUTE POOL](/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool) command to the
setup script of the app.

The following example shows how to create a compute pool within a stored procedure
in the setup script:

Copy code

```
CREATE COMPUTE POOL IF NOT EXISTS app_compute_pool
  MIN_NODES = 1
  MAX_NODES = 1
  INSTANCE_FAMILY = standard_1
  AUTO_RESUME = true;
```

Note

When creating a compute pool within the app, providers should check that the provider
has granted the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege before creating the compute pool.

Compute pools that an app creates are owned exclusively by that app. They cannot be used by other
applications or by the consumer directly.

In general, users in the consumer account can only see compute pools created by the app in the
following situations:

- The user has been granted the MANAGE GRANTS privilege.
- The app grants access to the compute pool using application roles.

Application developers can allow users with active roles specific privileges on applications owned by compute pools. In addition, administrators with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can grant themselves the privileges necessary to control the applications owned by compute pools. For more information about compute pool access requirements, see [ALTER COMPUTE POOL](/sql-reference/sql/alter-compute-pool).

### Prefix the compute pool within the setup script

Because compute pools are account-level objects, compute pool names must be unique within
the consumer account. The following example shows how to use the application name as a
prefix of the compute pool name:

Copy code

```
LET POOL_NAME := (select current_database()) || '_app_pool';
CREATE COMPUTE POOL IF NOT EXISTS identifier(:pool_name)
  MIN_NODES = 1
  MAX_NODES = 1
  INSTANCE_FAMILY = STANDARD_2;
```

## Choose different instance families for each provider

When creating a compute pool for an app that is published across multiple cloud
service providers, the code that creates the setup script must be written to account
for differences in how instance families are configured.

The following example shows how to write a stored procedure to create a compute pool
based on the cloud service provider where the app is being installed:

Copy code

```
 CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE public.create_cp()
 RETURNS VARCHAR
 LANGUAGE SQL
 EXECUTE AS OWNER
 AS $$
  BEGIN
      LET POOL_NAME := (select current_database()) || '_app_pool';
      LET INSTANCE_FAMILY := IFF( CONTAINS(current_region(), 'AZURE') , 'GPU_NV_XS' , 'GPU_NV_S' );
      CREATE COMPUTE POOL IF NOT EXISTS identifier(:pool_name)
          MIN_NODES = 1
          MAX_NODES = 1
          INSTANCE_FAMILY = :instance_family;
      RETURN 'Compute Pool Created';
  END;
$$;
```

## Uninstall an app that creates a compute pool or warehouse

To drop an app with containers that creates a compute pool or warehouse, the
consumer must use the `CASCADE` option to drop the app-owned resources. An attempt to drop
without the cascade option will fail.

For more information, see [Uninstall an app in Snowsight](/developer-guide/native-apps/ui-consumer-managing-applications#label-nativeapps-consumer-ui-uninstall).
