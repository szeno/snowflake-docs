# Share data content in a Snowflake Native App

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see
[Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](/developer-guide/native-apps/limitations#label-native-apps-supported-clouds).

This topic describes how providers can add shared data content to a Snowflake Native App.

Note

Providers can publish a Snowflake Native App to the Snowflake Marketplace as a limited trial listing. To publish
an app as a trial listing, see [Preparing to offer a limited trial listing](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/collaboration/provider-listings-preparing#label-prepare-limited-trial-listing).

## About shared data in a Snowflake Native App

The Snowflake Native App Framework allows providers to add shared data content to an app. This data content is shared with
the consumers when they install and use the app. To share data content, providers must grant privileges
on the shared data to the application package. Data content that providers share with an application
package is shared across all installed instances of the app.

Caution

Shared data content is not versioned, which means that all versions of an app use the same data.

Consumers cannot access shared content directly. Instead, a provider creates a secure view in the setup
script of an application package and grants the consumer access to the secure view.
For details, see [Allow consumers to access shared objects in an app](#label-native-apps-exposing-shared-objects-to-consumers).

### Database objects that can be shared

The Snowflake Native App Framework allows providers to add the following database objects to an application package:

- Schemas
- Tables, including external and Apache Iceberg™ tables
- Views

Note

When sharing database objects such as tables and views, you must also share the
schema that contains them.

The following restrictions apply to tables and views shared in an application package:

- Tables cannot have virtual columns, including policies containing Java, Python, or JavaScript code.
- View definitions or virtual columns associated with them such as policies cannot
  contain calls to Java, Python, or JavaScript.
- Shared tables cannot be temporary, volatile, or transient tables.
- Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment is not supported for apps that contain external or Apache Iceberg™ tables.

### Restrictions on sharing data content that contains policies

Some functions that are commonly referenced by policies, such as CURRENT\_USER, behave
differently in the context of an app installed in a consumer account. Although a policy
defined by a provider might work correctly in the provider account, it might not work correctly in the consumer account after the consumer
installs the app.

Snowflake recommends that providers define policies on the proxy views that are specified in
the setup script. Defining policies on the proxy views ensures that the definition of the policies
cannot be changed after an app is installed. Defining policies on proxy views also ensures
that during upgrades running code continues to use the policies that were applied when the version was
created.

## Grant privileges on shared content to an application package

To include shared data content in an app, providers must grant privileges on the object to be shared
with the application package. When providers add an object to an application
package, by default, the object is private to the application package and not visible when the
app is installed.

To make objects visible to an app installed from the application package, use the
GRANT … TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE command as shown in the following example:

Copy code

```
CREATE APPLICATION PACKAGE app_package;

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA app_package.shared_schema
  TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE app_package;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE app_package.shared_schema.shared_table
  TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE app_package;
```

In this example, the first command grants the USAGE privilege on the `shared_schema` schema to the
application package. This command allows the schema to be shared with consumers. The second command
grants the SELECT privilege on the `shared_table` table within `shared_schema` to the application
package. This command allows consumers to query the table.

After a consumer installs an app from the application package `app_package`, they can access the
`shared_schema` and query the `shared_table`.

Note

When adding a shared object to an application package, you must also share the schema that contains
the object.

You can also share views with an app by using similar SQL commands.

## Grant privileges on objects outside the application package

To share a database object that exists outside the application package, providers must create
views in the application package that allow access the object. You cannot share objects
outside the application package directly with app installed in the consumer account.

For example, to share a database that is outside the application package, grant the REFERENCE\_USAGE
privilege on the database to the application package as shown in the following example:

Copy code

```
GRANT REFERENCE_USAGE ON DATABASE other_db
  TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE app_pkg;
```

After granting the REFERENCE\_USAGE on the external database, a provider must create a view within the
application to references the shared objects as shown in the following example:

Copy code

```
CREATE VIEW app_pkg.shared_schema.shared_view
  AS SELECT c1, c2, c3, c4
  FROM other_db.other_schema.other_table;
```

This command creates a view in the application package that references the database, table,
and schema that are outside the application package.

After creating the view, you must grant privileges on the schema and view to the application
as shown in the following example:

Copy code

```
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA app_pkg.shared_schema
  TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE app_pkg;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW app_pkg.shared_schema.shared_view
  TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE app_pkg;
```

## Allow consumers to access shared objects in an app

Database objects that are created in the setup script are directly accessible to the app
after installation. These include tables, functions, procedures, and new view definitions,

However, by default, database objects shared with an application package are not visible to consumers.
To allow consumers to view and access data content, the application package must create a secure view
and grant the appropriate privileges.

This approach offers the following advantages:

- Creating the view in the setup script ensures that changes made directly to the
  shared objects, such as new columns, are not visible to the version of the Snowflake Native App being
  installed by the setup script. To allow access to changes to the object, providers must create a new
  version or patch for the app.
- Creating the view in a versioned schema ensures that each version of the Snowflake Native App contains
  only the definition of the view for that version. This is important for upgrade scenarios.

To expose shared objects to a consumer, the setup script must include commands to:

- Install views within a versioned schema in the application package.
- Grant access to those views to the consumer using an application role.

The following example describes how to use application roles to grant access to shared objects within the
setup script of the application package:

Copy code

```
CREATE APPLICATION ROLE app_user;

CREATE OR ALTER VERSIONED SCHEMA inst_schema;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA inst_schema
  TO APPLICATION ROLE app_user;

CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS inst_schema.shared_view
  AS SELECT c1, c2, c3, c4
  FROM shared_schema.shared_table;

GRANT SELECT ON VIEW inst_schema.shared_view
  TO APPLICATION ROLE app_user;
```

In this example, the view accesses content in the `shared_schema.shared_view` and shares it with the
application package.

Note

If a provider attempts to define a view that directly accesses shared data content, such as a
database object external to the application package, Snowflake returns an error.

## Define policies on proxy views

Snowflake recommends that you create proxy views and define policies to protect them within the
setup script. Defining policies to protect the proxy view ensures that the definition
of policies cannot be changed after the Snowflake Native App is installed. Defining policies on proxy
views also ensures that during upgrades running code continues to use the policies that are applied
when the upgraded version is created.

## Support for external and Apache Iceberg™ tables

The Snowflake Native App Framework allows providers to share [external tables](/user-guide/tables-external-intro) and
[Apache Iceberg™ tables](/user-guide/tables-iceberg) with consumers. The method for sharing these types
of tables is similar to normal tables in that providers add views to the setup script and grant
privileges on these views to an application role.

Caution

External and Apache Iceberg™ tables might incur additional egress or ingress costs to the provider or consumer
if the backing object store is not in the same region as the app listing.

The following restrictions and requirements apply when sharing an external or Iceberg table:

- External and Iceberg tables and views that access them are read-only for the app.
- Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment is [not supported for apps](#label-native-apps-ext-table-laf)
  that share external or Iceberg tables.
- Consumers must allow the app to use an external or Iceberg table in the provider account before it
  is available to the app.

### Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment is not supported

External and Iceberg tables are not supported for apps that have listings that enable
[Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment](/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment).

Note

To publish an app that uses external or Iceberg tables to multiple Snowflake regions, providers
must publish the listing to each region.

If a provider creates a listing for an app that includes an external or Iceberg table,
the ability to configure Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment is disabled in Snowsight.

If a provider attempts to add a version or patch to an application package that is the
data product of a listing that has Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment configured, Snowflake
returns an error.

### Add an external or Iceberg table to an app

In addition to adding an external or Iceberg table to the application package, providers must perform
the following:

- Add an entry to the manifest file to enable external and Iceberg tables. See
  [Add an entry for external and Iceberg tables to the manifest](/developer-guide/native-apps/requesting-external-tables#label-native-apps-ext-table-manifest)
  for more information.
- Providers can use the Python Permission SDK to allow consumers to use Snowsight to enable
  the app to access an external or Iceberg table. Alternately, providers can ask consumers to
  enable the external or Iceberg table manually.
  See [Request permissions to access external and Iceberg tables](/developer-guide/native-apps/requesting-external-tables#label-native-apps-ext-table-sdk)
  for more information.

## Use caution when revoking privileges on or dropping shared objects

Use caution when revoking privileges from shared objects in an application package or when dropping
shared objects. If an installed version of a Snowflake Native App still requires access to those objects,
the Snowflake Native App might become unstable or fail.

## Considerations when granting the MONITOR or OPERATE privilege on dynamic tables

Providers should use caution when granting the MONITOR or OPERATE privilege on dynamic tables to an
application role. These privileges allow the consumer to view a dynamic table’s metadata, which might
expose the implementation details of the app. See [Grant MONITOR to view metadata](/user-guide/dynamic-tables/privileges#label-dynamic-tables-privileges-view-metadata) for
more information on what actions the consumer can perform.

## Revoke and drop permissions on shared objects

Use caution when revoking permissions on shared objects from an application package or when dropping shared
objects. If an installed version of the Snowflake Native App still requires access to those objects,
the Snowflake Native App might become unstable or fail.
