# Tutorial 2: Create an app with containers

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see
[Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](/developer-guide/native-apps/limitations#label-native-apps-supported-clouds).

## Introduction

The Snowflake Native App Framework allows providers to build, sell, and distribute apps within the
Snowflake Data Cloud. Providers can create apps that leverage core Snowflake functionality to share data
and application logic with consumers. The logic of a Snowflake Native App can include features such as stored procedures and user-defined functions (UDFs). Providers can share their applications with consumers through listings in the
Snowflake Marketplace or through private listings.

A Snowflake Native App can implement Snowpark Container Services to facilitate the deployment, management, and scaling of
containerized apps within the Snowflake ecosystem. This tutorial describes how to create a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services, which is
a Snowflake Native App that runs container workloads in Snowflake. Snowflake Native Apps with Snowpark Container Services can run any containerized services, while
leveraging all of the features of the Snowflake Native App Framework, including security, logging, shared data content and application logic.

Note

This tutorial uses both Snowflake CLI and Snowsight to perform the required tasks.

### What you learn in this tutorial

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

- Use Snowflake CLI to initialize a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services project.
- Build a Docker image for an app.
- Create the application package and required application files for a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services.
- Test a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services by calling the service function within the container.

### Set up your Snowflake environment

To perform this tutorial, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- Access to a Snowflake account that supports Snowpark Container Services.
- You must be able to use the ACCOUNTADMIN role to create the role used in this
  tutorial and grant the required privileges to that role.
- You must have [Snowflake CLI](/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/index)
  version `3.0.0` or greater installed on your local machine.
- You must have Docker Desktop installed on your local machine.

## Set up a role for this tutorial

This tutorial walks you through the process of creating a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services using the
`tutorial_role` role. Before working through this tutorial, a Snowflake user with the
ACCOUNTADMIN role must perform the following steps to configure this role.

To create and set up the `tutorial_role` role, follow these steps:

1. To create the `tutorial_role` role, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE ROLE tutorial_role;
   ```
2. To grant the `tutorial_role` to the Snowflake user who performs the tutorial, run the
   following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   GRANT ROLE tutorial_role TO USER <user_name>;
   ```

   Where:

   `user_name`
   :   Specifies the name of the user who performs the tutorial.
3. To grant the privileges required to create and use the Snowflake objects required by a container
   app, run the following commands:

   Copy code

   ```
   GRANT CREATE INTEGRATION ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE tutorial_role;
   GRANT CREATE WAREHOUSE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE tutorial_role;
   GRANT CREATE DATABASE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE tutorial_role;
   GRANT CREATE APPLICATION PACKAGE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE tutorial_role;
   GRANT CREATE APPLICATION ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE tutorial_role;
   GRANT CREATE COMPUTE POOL ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE tutorial_role WITH GRANT OPTION;
   GRANT BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE tutorial_role WITH GRANT OPTION;
   ```

After performing the tasks in this section, the user that has the `tutorial_role` role granted
to their account has the permissions to create all of the Snowflake objects required to
create a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services.

You use this role through the rest of this tutorial.

In a real-world situation, a provider may need similar privileges or access to
existing objects to develop an app with containers, including a compute pool, warehouse, and database.

## Create the required objects in your account

In this section, you create the Snowflake objects required by an app with containers.

### Create a warehouse and image repository

To create the required objects, perform the following either through Snowsight or Snowflake CLI.

1. To set the current context in Snowsight to use the `tutorial_role` role, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE tutorial_role;
   ```

   If you are using Snowflake CLI, you can use `--role tutorial_role` instead.
2. To create a warehouse for the Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE tutorial_warehouse WITH
     WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'X-SMALL'
     AUTO_SUSPEND = 180
     AUTO_RESUME = true
     INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = false;
   ```

   A warehouse is required by the Snowflake Native App to run SQL commands and stored procedures.
3. To create the image repository used to store the container, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE DATABASE tutorial_image_database;
   CREATE SCHEMA tutorial_image_schema;
   CREATE IMAGE REPOSITORY tutorial_image_repo;
   ```

In this section, you created a warehouse that is used to execute queries for the app
you create, as well as an image repository to host container images.

In the next section you create an image for the container and upload it to the
image repository you created above.

## Create a Snowflake CLI connection for the tutorial

To run the Snowflake CLI commands in this tutorial, you must set up a Snowflake CLI connection for the tutorial.

To create a connection, perform the following tasks:

1. From the terminal, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow connection add
   ```
2. Enter `tut-connection` for the name of the connection.
3. Enter additional information for the Snowflake CLI connection.

   The specific values you use depend on your Snowflake account. However, you must use the following
   values for the role, warehouse, database, and schema properties:

   | Parameter | Required value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Role for the connection | tutorial\_role |
   | Warehouse for the connection | tutorial\_warehouse |
   | Database for the connection | tutorial\_image\_database |
   | Schema for the connection | tutorial\_image\_schema |

   Expand

   Show lessSee more
4. Verify the connection by running the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow connection test -c tut-connection
   ```

   The output of this command should look similar to the following:

   Copy code

   ```
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | key             | value                                                          |
   |-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Connection name | tut-connection                                                 |
   | Status          | OK                                                             |
   | Host            | USER_ACCOUNT.snowflakecomputing.com                            |
   | Account         | USER_ACCOUNT                                                   |
   | User            | tutorial_user                                                  |
   | Role            | TUTORIAL_ROLE                                                  |
   | Database        | TUTORIAL_IMAGE_DATABASE                                        |
   | Warehouse       | TUTORIAL_WAREHOUSE                                             |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   ```

Caution

If you do not create the `tut-connection` connection, you must use a connection that
specifies the correct values for the role, database, and warehouse connection properties.

## Set up a project for the app

In the previous section, you set up a Snowflake CLI connection for the tutorial.

In this section, you use Snowflake CLI to create a project for your app. A project contains
all of the assets required by an app. These files are stored on your local file system and can be
managed by a version control system as part of your development workflow.

### Create a project file using the Snowflake CLI

1. To create a project file, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow init --template app_basic na-spcs-tutorial
   ```
2. Enter a value for the project identifier.
   You add additional files and subfolders to this folder and edit the files
   this command created in later subsections.

This command creates a folder named `na-spcs-tutorial` using the `app_basic` project template.

Within the `na-spcs-tutorial` folder, this command creates the following files and folders:

```
├── README.md
├── app
    └── manifest.yml
    └── README.md
    └── setup_script.sql
├── snowflake.yml
```

In later sections you modify these files and add additional resources to your app.

### Add the service files to the app project

In the previous section you created a project which includes the default application
files required by your app. In this section, you add the files required to create the container for your app.

1. Create a folder called `service` inside the `na-spcs-tutorial` folder.

   This folder contains the source code for the container-based service you are about to build and publish to Snowflake.
2. To obtain the Docker files required for the tutorial, download the
   [na\_spcs\_tutorial.zip](/static/samples/native-apps/na-spcs-tutorial.zip) file to your local file system.
3. Unzip the contents of the zip file into the `na-spcs-tutorial/service` folder. This folder
   should contain the following files:

   - `echo_service.py`
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `templates/basic_ui.html`
   - `echo_spec.yaml`

### Verify the directory structure of your project

After creating the project for your app and adding the files for the service and Docker container, the project
should have the following structure within the `na-spcs-tutorial` folder:

```
├── app
      └── manifest.yml
      └── README.md
      └── setup_script.sql
├── README.md
├── service
      └── echo_service.py
      ├── echo_spec.yaml
      ├── Dockerfile
      └── templates
         └── basic_ui.html
├── snowflake.yml
```

## Build an image for a Snowpark Container Services service

In this section, you build a Docker image and upload it to the image repository you
created in the previous section.

### Build a Docker image and upload it to the image repository

To build a Docker image and upload it to the image repository, follow these steps:

1. From a terminal window, change to the `na-spcs-tutorial/service` folder.
2. Run the following Docker CLI command. Note that you must specify the current working
   directory (.) in the command:

   Copy code

   ```
   docker build --rm --platform linux/amd64 -t my_echo_service_image:tutorial .
   ```

   This command performs the following:

   - Builds a Docker image using the Docker file included in the zip file that you downloaded
   - Names the image `my_echo_service_image`
   - Applies the `tutorial` tag to the image.
3. To identify the URL of the image repository you created in a previous section, run the following
   command:

   Copy code

   ```
   REPO_URL=$(snow spcs image-repository url tutorial_image_database.tutorial_image_schema.tutorial_image_repo -c tut-connection)
   echo $REPO_URL
   ```

   The URL of the image repository is captured in the `$REPO_URL` variable, then printed to the console.
   You use this value in the next step.
4. To create a tag for the image that includes the image URL, run the following Docker CLI command:

   Copy code

   ```
   docker tag <image_name> <image_url>/<image_name>
   ```

   This command requires two parameters:

   - `<image_name>`
     Specifies the name of the image and tag.
   - `<image_url>/<image_name>`
     Specifies the URL of the image repository where the image is uploaded and the image name
     and tag where it should be stored in the remote repository.

   For this tutorial, use `$REPO_URL` and `my_echo_service_image:tutorial`:

   Copy code

   ```
   docker tag my_echo_service_image:tutorial $REPO_URL/my_echo_service_image:tutorial
   ```
5. To authenticate with the Snowflake registry, run the following Snowflake CLI command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow spcs image-registry login -c tut-connection
   ```

   This command loads necessary credentials required for the Docker CLI to use the image repositories
   in your Snowflake account. You must specify the connection name, if you are not using the default.

   The message `Login Succeeded` displays if everything was successful.
6. To upload the Docker image to the image repository, run the following `docker push` command:

   Copy code

   ```
   docker push $REPO_URL/<image_name>
   ```

   Using the same value as `<image_name>` from previous steps, this command is:

   Copy code

   ```
   docker push $REPO_URL/my_echo_service_image:tutorial
   ```
7. Confirm the image was uploaded successfully by running the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow spcs image-repository list-images tutorial_image_database.tutorial_image_schema.tutorial_image_repo -c tut-connection
   ```

In this section, you created a Docker image containing the echo service and pushed it to the
`tutorial_repository` image repository you created earlier in the tutorial.

In the next section, you create an application package that uses this image.

## Develop your Snowflake Native App

In a previous section, you used the Snowflake CLI to create a project file based on a project template. This template
created default versions of the files required by the app.

In this section, you update these default files for your app:

Project Definition file
:   A YAML file that contains information about the Snowflake object(s) that you want to create.
    This file is called `snowflake.yml` and is used by Snowflake CLI to deploy the application
    package and object into your account.

Manifest file
:   A YAML file that contains basic configuration and callback information about the application.
    This file is called `manifest.yml`.

Setup Script
:   An SQL script that runs automatically when a consumer installs an application in
    their account. This file can be called whatever you like, as long as it is referenced
    by your manifest.

The first file is used by Snowflake CLI, while the latter two are required by the Snowflake Native App Framework.

You learn more about these files, and their contents, throughout this tutorial.

In this section, you also create a readme file that is useful when viewing and publishing your
app.

### Modify the default manifest file

To modify the manifest file for the app, follow these steps:

1. Modify `na-spcs-tutorial/app/manifest.yml` to look like the following:

   Copy code

   ```
   manifest_version: 1

   artifacts:
   setup_script: setup_script.sql
   readme: README.md
   container_services:
      images:
      - /tutorial_image_database/tutorial_image_schema/tutorial_image_repo/my_echo_service_image:tutorial

   privileges:
   - BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT:
     description: "A service that can respond to requests from public endpoints."
   - CREATE COMPUTE POOL:
     description: "Permission to create compute pools for running services"
   ```

   This example includes the following:

   - The `artifacts` property specifies the locations of resources required by an app
     with containers, including the location of the Docker image you created in a previous step,
     as well as the project README that is visible in Snowsight.
   - The `privileges` property allows a service to respond to public requests as well
     as to create its own compute pool. These properties are required for instantiating the service
     in the next step of the tutorial.

### Modify the default setup script

To modify the default setup script for the application package, follow these steps:

1. Modify the `na-spcs-tutorial/app/setup_script.sql` file to include the following:

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE APPLICATION ROLE IF NOT EXISTS app_user;

   CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS core;
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA core TO APPLICATION ROLE app_user;

   CREATE OR ALTER VERSIONED SCHEMA app_public;
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA app_public TO APPLICATION ROLE app_user;

   CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE app_public.start_app()
   RETURNS string
   LANGUAGE sql
   AS
   $$
   BEGIN
   -- account-level compute pool object prefixed with app name to prevent clashes
   LET pool_name := (SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE()) || '_compute_pool';

   CREATE COMPUTE POOL IF NOT EXISTS IDENTIFIER(:pool_name)
      MIN_NODES = 1
      MAX_NODES = 1
      INSTANCE_FAMILY = CPU_X64_XS
      AUTO_RESUME = true;

   CREATE SERVICE IF NOT EXISTS core.echo_service
      IN COMPUTE POOL identifier(:pool_name)
      FROM spec='service/echo_spec.yaml';

   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION core.my_echo_udf (TEXT VARCHAR)
      RETURNS varchar
      SERVICE=core.echo_service
      ENDPOINT=echoendpoint
      AS '/echo';

   GRANT USAGE ON FUNCTION core.my_echo_udf (varchar) TO APPLICATION ROLE app_user;

   RETURN 'Service successfully created';
   END;
   $$;

   GRANT USAGE ON PROCEDURE app_public.start_app() TO APPLICATION ROLE app_user;

   CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE app_public.service_status()
   RETURNS TABLE ()
   LANGUAGE SQL
   EXECUTE AS OWNER
   AS $$
   BEGIN
         LET stmt VARCHAR := 'SHOW SERVICE CONTAINERS IN SERVICE core.echo_service';
         LET res RESULTSET := (EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :stmt);
         RETURN TABLE(res);
   END;
   $$;

   GRANT USAGE ON PROCEDURE app_public.service_status() TO APPLICATION ROLE app_user;
   ```

### Modify the default README

To modify the README file for the app, follow these steps:

1. Modify `na-spcs-tutorial/app/README.md` to look like the following:

   ```
   Welcome to your first app with containers!
   ```

This README file is visible to consumers after they install your app.

### Modify the default project definition file

In this section, you modify the project definition file used by the Snowflake CLI.

1. Modify `na-spcs-tutorial/snowflake.yml` to look like the following:

   Copy code

   ```
   definition_version: 2
   entities:
   na_spcs_tutorial_pkg:
      type: application package
      manifest: app/manifest.yml
      artifacts:
         - src: app/*
           dest: ./
         - service/echo_spec.yaml
      meta:
         role: tutorial_role
         warehouse: tutorial_warehouse
   na_spcs_tutorial_app:
      type: application
      from:
         target: na_spcs_tutorial_pkg
      debug: false
      meta:
         role: tutorial_role
         warehouse: tutorial_warehouse
   ```

In this section, you defined a local file structure that can be deployed to a Snowflake account
as a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services. In the next section, you perform this deployment using Snowflake CLI.

## Create and test the app

After defining the manifest file, setup script, and service specification for your Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services,
you can test the app by deploying it to your account using Snowflake CLI.

### Upload files to the stage and create the application object

To create an app in development mode, follow these steps:

1. In a terminal, change to the `na-spcs-tutorial` folder.
2. Create the application package and object in your account by running the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow app run -c tut-connection
   ```

   This command displays a confirmation that an application package called
   `na_spcs_tutorial_pkg` and an application object called `na_spcs_tutorial_app`
   have been created in your account. These names correspond to the names in the
   `snowflake.yml` project definition you modified in a previous section.

You can use the URL output to the console to view the application. However,
you must first ensure it has all necessary privileges to create its container-based service.

### Grant the privileges and test the app

In this section, you grant the required privileges to the app and test the app by
calling the services in the container.

You can run SQL commands using either Snowsight or the Snowflake CLI.

To grant the privileges and test the app, perform the following steps from a Snowflake worksheet:

1. Grant the `CREATE COMPUTE POOL` privilege to the app by running the following:

   Copy code

   ```
   GRANT CREATE COMPUTE POOL ON ACCOUNT TO APPLICATION na_spcs_tutorial_app;
   GRANT BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT ON ACCOUNT TO APPLICATION na_spcs_tutorial_app;
   ```
2. Run the `app_public.start_app` procedure defined in the `setup_script.sql` file.

   Copy code

   ```
   CALL na_spcs_tutorial_app.app_public.start_app();
   ```

   This procedure creates the compute pool, instantiates the service, and creates the service function.
3. Confirm the function was created by running the following:

   Copy code

   ```
   SHOW FUNCTIONS LIKE '%my_echo_udf%' IN APPLICATION na_spcs_tutorial_app;
   ```

   Note

   Consumers cannot see the running service because it runs as part of the Snowflake Native App.
   For example, running `SHOW SERVICES IN APPLICATION na_spcs_tutorial_app;` does not
   return anything.
4. To verify that the service has been created and is healthy, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   CALL na_spcs_tutorial_app.app_public.service_status();
   ```

   This statement calls the `app_public.service_status` procedure that you defined in the setup script. The procedure returns information about the containers for this service.

   If the value in the `status` column is not `READY`, execute the statement again, until the status of the service container is `READY`.
5. To call the service function to send a request to the service and verify the response, run
   the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT na_spcs_tutorial_app.core.my_echo_udf('hello');
   ```

   You see the following message from the service you configured in an earlier section:

   ```
   ``Bob said hello``
   ```

## Tear down the app and objects created in the tutorial

Caution

If you plan to perform the [Tutorial 3: Upgrade an app with containers](/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/na-upgrade-tutorial) after completing this tutorial,
do not perform the steps in this section. The app with containers you created in this tutorial
is a prerequisite for the upgrade tutorial.

Because the app uses a compute pool, it accrues credits in your account
and costs money to run. To stop the app from consuming resources, you must tear down
both the application object and any of the account-level objects it created, for example the
compute pool.

1. To confirm that the compute pool is currently running, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow object list compute-pool -l "na_spcs_tutorial_app_%"
   ```

   If the compute pool is running, a row with an `ACTIVE` compute pool that was created by the
   application object is displayed.
2. Run the following Snowflake CLI command to tear down the app:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow app teardown --cascade --force -c tut-connection
   ```

   This command removes all of the Snowflake objects created by the app. Without the `--force` option,
   this command does not drop the application package because it contains versions.
3. To confirm that the compute pool was dropped, run the following command again:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow object list compute-pool -l "na_spcs_tutorial_app_%"
   ```

   This command returns `no data` if the compute pool has been dropped successfully.

Note

The `snow app teardown` command drops both the application package and application object.
Therefore, any stateful data is lost.
