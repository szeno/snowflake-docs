# Tutorial 3: Upgrade an app with containers

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see
[Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](/developer-guide/native-apps/limitations#label-native-apps-supported-clouds).

## Introduction

The Snowflake Native App Framework allows providers to build, sell, and distribute apps within the Snowflake Data Cloud. Providers can
create apps that leverage core Snowflake functionality to share data and application logic with consumers. Apps
can also implement Snowpark Container Services to facilitate the deployment, management, and scaling of
containerized apps within the Snowflake ecosystem.

The Snowflake Native App Framework allows providers to make updates to an app and publish new version or patch to consumers. This tutorial
describes how to perform the following tasks:

- Add a version initializer to the app.
- Create versions and patches for changes made to the app.
- Upgrade the app in the consumer account.

### Prerequisite tutorials

This tutorial assumes that you know how to develop a basic Snowflake Native App and can create
a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services. This tutorial builds on the knowledge gained from completing the following tutorials:

- [Tutorial 1: Create a basic Snowflake Native App](/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/getting-started-tutorial)
- [Tutorial 2: Create an app with containers](/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/na-spcs-tutorial)

Before following this tutorial to upgrade an app with containers, ensure that you have completed both
of these tutorials.

Caution

This tutorial builds on the app you created in [Tutorial 2: Create an app with containers](/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/na-spcs-tutorial). If
you do not have the application files and Snowflake objects in your account, you must work through that tutorial
again before starting this tutorial. See [Verify the app from the previous tutorial exists in your account](#label-na-spcs-upgrade-verify-previous) for more information.

### What you learn in this tutorial

This tutorial expands the app with containers you created in
[Tutorial 2: Create an app with containers](/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/na-spcs-tutorial). In this tutorial you learn how to:

- Use the version initializer callback function to handle service upgrades and failures.
- Create version definitions for an app.
- Upgrade an app.
- Simulate upgrade failure for an app.
- Create a patch for the app to fix the failure.

## Verify the app from the previous tutorial exists in your account

To verify that the app with containers you created in [Tutorial 2: Create an app with containers](/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/na-spcs-tutorial)
is still available in your account, perform the following tasks:

Caution

If any of the following tasks does not complete successfully, you will need to perform
[Tutorial 2: Create an app with containers](/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/na-spcs-tutorial) again.

1. To verify that Snow CLI is configured correctly, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow connection test -c tut-connection
   ```

   The output of this command should be similar to the following:

   ```
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | key             | value                                                          |
   |-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Connection name | tut-connection                                                 |
   | Status          | OK                                                             |
   | Host            | USER_ACCOUNT.snowflakecomputing.com                            |
   | Account         | USER_ACCOUNT                                                   |
   | User            | tutorial_user                                                  |
   | Role            | TUTORIAL_ROLE                                                  |
   | Database        | TUTORIAL_IMAGE_DATABASE                                        |
   | Warehouse       | TUTORIAL_WAREHOUSE                                             |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   ```

   This command verifies the following requirements:

   - The Snow CLI connection is working.
   - The TUTORIAL\_ROLE exists.
   - The TUTORIAL\_WAREHOUSE exists.
2. To verify that the other required Snowflake objects exist, run the following commands from a worksheet:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE tutorial_role;
   ```

   Copy code

   ```
   SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'tutorial_image_database';
   ```

   Copy code

   ```
   SHOW SCHEMAS LIKE 'tutorial_image_schema';
   ```

   Copy code

   ```
   SHOW IMAGE REPOSITORIES LIKE 'tutorial_image_repo';
   ```

   Each of these commands should return the name of each Snowflake object.
3. To verify that the service is still running, run the following command from a worksheet:

   Copy code

   ```
   CALL na_spcs_tutorial_app.app_public.service_status();
   ```
4. Ensure that your local directory structure looks like the following example:

   ```
   ├── app
    └── manifest.yml
    └── README.md
    └── setup_script.sql
   ├── README.md
   ├── service
    └── echo_service.py
    ├── echo_spec.yaml
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── templates
        └── basic_ui.html
   ├── snowflake.yml
   ```

   You may also see a folder called `output` that contains the app files generated by the `snow app run` command.

### Drop the application object

If the app you created when working through [Tutorial 2: Create an app with containers](/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/na-spcs-tutorial)
still exists in your account, you must drop the application object before proceeding with this tutorial.

Note

You must drop the existing app because an app created in development mode directly from staged files cannot be upgraded.

1. To determine whether the app from the previous tutorial (`na_spcs_tutorial_app`) exists in your account, run
   the following command from a worksheet:

   Copy code

   ```
   SHOW APPLICATIONS LIKE 'na_spcs_tutorial_app';
   ```
2. If the `na_spcs_tutorial_app` app appears in the output of this command, drop the app by running the following commands
   from a worksheet:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE tutorial_role;
   DROP APPLICATION IF EXISTS na_spcs_tutorial_app CASCADE;
   ```

### What you completed in this section

In this section, you verified that the application files and Snowflake objects from the previous tutorial are still
working in your account.

In the next section, you will learn more about versions and upgrades in the Snowflake Native App Framework.

## Understand versions, patches and upgrades

The section introduces you to the concepts covered in this tutorial, including:

- Versions and patches
- Upgrades
- The version initializer

### About versions and patches

Versions in the Snowflake Native App Framework are combinations of version and patch numbers. These are defined in the application package.

. rst-class:: bulleted-definition-list

Version
:   Generally contains major updates to a Snowflake Native App. Versions are defined in an application package.

Patch
:   Generally contains smaller updates to a Snowflake Native App. Like versions, patches are defined in the
    application package.

Note

An application package can only have two active versions at one time. A single version of an app can have up to 130 patches.

### About upgrades

Within the context of the Snowflake Native App Framework, upgrades are updates to a version or patch of a Snowflake Native App that is
installed in the consumer account. The Snowflake Native App Framework supports two types of upgrades:

Automated upgrades
:   Automated upgrades are upgrades that are initiated by the provider. When a new version or patch is
    available, the provider modifies the release directive on the application package. This triggers an
    automatic upgrade of all installed instances of the app specified by the release directive.

Manual upgrades
:   Manual upgrades are upgrades that are initiated by the consumer in response to communication from
    the provider. Manual upgrades are useful when a provider needs to quickly release an update, such as a bug fix, to a consumer.

    Note

    This tutorials describes how to perform a manual upgrade for an app with containers.

When a new version or patch is available, the provider modifies the release directive on the
application package and then notifies the consumer that a new version is available.

The consumer performs the upgrade by running the [ALTER APPLICATION](/sql-reference/sql/alter-application)
command in their account to perform the upgrade. In general, manual upgrades allow the consumer to upgrade their
installed app faster than automated upgrades.

### About the version initializer

A version initializer is used to start or upgrade services or other related processes. The version initializer
is a callback stored procedure defined in the manifest file and implemented in the setup script. The version
initializer callback function is invoked in the following contexts:

- During installation, the version initializer is called as soon as the setup script of the app finishes without
  errors.
- During upgrade, there are two possible scenarios where the version initializer is called:
  - If the setup script of the new version succeeds, then the new version of the version initializer is called.
  - If the setup script or the version initializer of the new version fails, then the version initializer of the
    previous version is called. This allows the version initializer of the previous version to use the
    [ALTER SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-service) command to revert the services to the previous version.

## Add a version initializer to the app

In the previous tutorial, you created a basic app with containers. In this section you update this app
to add a version initializer to the app. You also add a version to the application package.

### Add the version initializer to the manifest file

The version initializer is defined in the manifest file of the app. To define the version initializer, add
the following code to the end of the manifest file:

Copy code

```
lifecycle_callbacks:
  version_initializer: app_public.version_init
```

This specifies the schema and name of the stored procedure used as the version initializer. In the next section,
you implement the `version_init` stored procedure.

### Add the version initializer as a stored procedure to the setup script

In the previous section, you added the name of the version initializer to the manifest file. In this section,
you add the code for the stored procedure to the setup script.

1. Add the following code at the end of the `setup_script.sql` file:

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE app_public.version_init()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
DECLARE
can_create_compute_pool BOOLEAN;  -- Flag to check if 'CREATE COMPUTE POOL' privilege is held
BEGIN
-- Check if the account holds the 'CREATE COMPUTE POOL' privilege
   SELECT SYSTEM$HOLD_PRIVILEGE_ON_ACCOUNT('CREATE COMPUTE POOL')
      INTO can_create_compute_pool;

   ALTER SERVICE IF EXISTS core.echo_service
      FROM SPECIFICATION_FILE = 'service/echo_spec.yaml';
   IF (can_create_compute_pool) THEN
      -- When installing app, the app has no 'CREATE COMPUTE POOL' privilege at that time,
      -- so it will not execute the code below

      -- Since the ALTER SERVICE is an async process, wait for the service to be ready
      SELECT SYSTEM$WAIT_FOR_SERVICES(120, 'core.echo_service');
   END IF;
   RETURN 'DONE';
END;
$$;
```

### Upload the changed files and create a version

After modifying the setup script, upload the modified files to the stage and create a version
by performing the following procedure:

1. Run the following command to upload the files and create a version:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow app version create v1 -c tut-connection
   ```

The `snow app version` command uploads the updated files to the stage. If the application
package and files already exist, this command only uploads files that have changed.

This command creates a new version of the app called v1 with the default patch set to 0.

### Set the default release directive for the app

In the previous section, you uploaded the changed files and created version `v1` of the app. In this
section, you set the default release directive to use version `v1`.

To update the default release directive run the following command from a worksheet:

Copy code

```
ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE na_spcs_tutorial_pkg
  SET DEFAULT RELEASE DIRECTIVE VERSION=v1 PATCH=0;
```

When you set the default release directive for an app, consumers automatically install that
version when they install the app in their account. In the next section, you create the app
in your local account based on the release directive.

### Create and test the app

Now that you have added a version and set the default release directive, you can create the app
and grant the required privileges:

1. Create the app from the release directive by running the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow app run --from-release-directive -c tut-connection
   ```

   This command creates the app using the release directive you defined in the previous section.
2. After creating the app, grant the required privileges to the app to be able to run it by running
   the following commands from a worksheet.

   Copy code

   ```
   GRANT CREATE COMPUTE POOL ON ACCOUNT TO APPLICATION na_spcs_tutorial_app;
   GRANT BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT ON ACCOUNT TO APPLICATION na_spcs_tutorial_app;
   ```
3. Call the `app_public.start_app` procedure that you defined in the `setup_script.sql`
   file: by running the following command from a worksheet:

   Copy code

   ```
   CALL na_spcs_tutorial_app.app_public.start_app();
   ```
4. Confirm the function was created by running the following command from a worksheet:

   Copy code

   ```
   SHOW FUNCTIONS LIKE '%my_echo_udf%' IN APPLICATION na_spcs_tutorial_app;
   ```
5. To verify that the service has been created and healthy, run the following command from a worksheet:

   Copy code

   ```
   CALL na_spcs_tutorial_app.app_public.service_status();
   ```
6. To call the service function to send a request to the service and verify the response,
   run the following command from a worksheet:

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT na_spcs_tutorial_app.core.my_echo_udf('hello');
   ```
7. To view information about the app, run the following command from a worksheet:

   Copy code

   ```
   DESC APPLICATION na_spcs_tutorial_app;
   ```

### Review what you learned in this section

In this section, you completed the following tasks:

- Learned about the version initializer and how you can add it to the manifest file and
  the setup script.
- Learned the basics of versions and patches in the Snowflake Native App Framework.
- Set the default release directive to point to a specific version of an app.
- Installed the app based on the release directive.
- Tested the app by calling a stored procedure and used the [DESCRIBE APPLICATION](/sql-reference/sql/desc-application)
  command to view the status of the app.

Note

In this tutorial you created the application object in your local account and used
the [DESCRIBE APPLICATION](/sql-reference/sql/desc-application) command. This mimics the behavior of the app in the
consumer account.

## Update the app and upgrade to a new version

In the previous section, you modified the original app by adding the version initializer
as a stored procedure. You also created a new version of the app, version v1, based on the
default release directive.

In this section, you make another change to the app, create version v2, update the default
release directive, and upgrade the installed app from version v1 to version v2.

### Add a new table to the app

To simulate adding a new feature to your app, add a new table to the setup script.

1. Add the following commands to the end of the `setup_script.yml`

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS core.setup_script_run(run_at TIMESTAMP);
   GRANT SELECT ON TABLE core.setup_script_run to APPLICATION ROLE app_user;
   INSERT INTO core.setup_script_run(run_at) values(current_timestamp());
   ```

### Create a version of the app

To upload the modified setup script to the stage and create version v2 of the app:

1. Run the following command inside the `na-spcs-tutorial` folder:

Copy code

```
snow app version create v2 -c tut-connection
```

This command creates a new version of the app called v2 with the default patch set to 0.

The `snow app version` command uploads the updated files to the stage. If the application package
and files already exist, this command only uploads files that have changed.

### Set the default release directive for the app

After creating version `v2` of the app, set the release directive for the application
package by running the following command from a worksheet:

Copy code

```
ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE na_spcs_tutorial_pkg
  SET DEFAULT RELEASE DIRECTIVE VERSION=v2 PATCH=0;
```

This command sets the release directive to version `v2` and patch `0`.

### Upgrade the app from v1 to v2

Now that you have updated the release directive to point to the new version, upgrade the app
by running the following command from a worksheet:

Copy code

```
snow app run --from-release-directive -c tut-connection
```

### Test the upgraded app

After upgrading the app, test the app by running the following command from a worksheet:

Copy code

```
SELECT na_spcs_tutorial_app.core.my_echo_udf('hello');
```

### Review what you learned in this section

Congratulations! You successfully upgraded the app from version `v1` to version `v2`.

In this section, you completed the following tasks:

- Updated the app to include a table.
- Created a new version for the app based on this update.
- Updated the default release directive to point to the new version.
- Manually upgraded the app.

In the next section, you upgrade the service of the app and simulate an error in
the upgrade process by intentionally adding an error in the setup script.

## Simulate an upgrade error

In the previous section, you added a new table to the app, created a new version, and
upgraded the app.

In this section you update the service specification to simulate an update to the service.
You also add an intentional error to the setup script to simulate an upgrade failure, which
shows you how the version initializer handles service upgrades when the upgrade fails.

### Update the service specification file

In this section, you update the service specification of the app to simulate a change to
the service.

1. In the `service/echo_spec.yaml` file, change the value of `CHARACTER_NAME` from `Bob` to `Tom`.

   This change causes the service to return the following message:

   ```
   `Tom said hello.`
   ```

The purpose of this change is to allow you to see which version of the service is running after attempting
an upgrade in the following sections.

### Update the setup script to include an intentional error

To simulate an error during the upgrade process, introduce an intentional error in the setup
script by adding a SELECT statement for a table that does not exist.

Add the following statement to the end of the `app_public.version_init()` procedure in the `setup_script.sql`.

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM table_does_not_exist;
```

This statement is syntactically correct, but refers to a table that does not exist. This causes an error when the setup
script runs during upgrade.

After making this change, the `app_public.version_init()` function should look like the following example:

Copy code

```
GRANT USAGE ON PROCEDURE app_public.service_status() TO APPLICATION ROLE app_user;

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE app_public.version_init()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
DECLARE
  -- Flag to check if 'CREATE COMPUTE POOL' privilege is held
  can_create_compute_pool BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
   -- Check if the account holds the 'CREATE COMPUTE POOL' privilege
   SELECT SYSTEM$HOLD_PRIVILEGE_ON_ACCOUNT('CREATE COMPUTE POOL')
     INTO can_create_compute_pool;

   ALTER SERVICE IF EXISTS core.echo_service
     FROM SPECIFICATION_FILE = 'service/echo_spec.yaml';
   IF (can_create_compute_pool) THEN
     -- When installing app, the app has no 'CREATE COMPUTE POOL' privilege at that time,
     -- so it will not execute the code below

     -- Since the ALTER SERVICE is an async process, wait for the service to be ready
     SELECT SYSTEM$WAIT_FOR_SERVICES(120, 'core.echo_service');
   END IF;

   -- trigger an error. The upgrade fails
   SELECT * FROM non_exist_table;

   RETURN 'DONE';
END;
$$;
```

### Upload the revised files and create a new patch

In previous sections, you updated the service specification and setup script of the app.

To upload the files and create a new patch for the app, perform the following tasks:

1. Run the following command to add a patch to the application package.

Copy code

```
snow app version create v2 --patch 1 -c tut-connection
```

1. When prompted, enter `y` to add a new patch to the application package.

### Set the default release directive for the app

In the previous section, you uploaded the files and created a patch for the updates.
To set the default release directive for the patch, run the following command from a worksheet:

Copy code

```
ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE na_spcs_tutorial_pkg
  SET DEFAULT RELEASE DIRECTIVE VERSION=v2 PATCH=1;
```

This command sets that patch for the app to patch `1`.

### Upgrade the app

In the previous sections, you made updates to the app and created a new patch. In
this section, you upgrade the app with the expectation that it fails due to the error
you introduced in previous sections.

To upgrade the app, run the following command:

Copy code

```
snow app run --from-release-directive -c tut-connection
```

To view the upgrade state of the app, run the following command from a worksheet:

Copy code

```
DESC APPLICATION na_spcs_tutorial_app;
```

This command displays information about the app including the upgrade state, the number of upgrade attempts,
and the reason for an upgrade failure.

After the upgrade fails, Snowflake CLI returns the following message:

```
Object 'TABLE_DOES_NOT_EXIST' does not exist or not authorized.'
```

Also, after the upgrade fails, the DESC APPLICATION command displays the following properties
related to upgrades:

> | Property | Value |
> | --- | --- |
> | upgrade\_state | FAILED |
> | upgrade\_failure\_reason | upgrade\_failure\_reason[ErrorCode 2003] Uncaught exception of type ‘STATEMENT\_ERROR’ on line 89 at position 0 : Uncaught exception of type ‘STATEMENT\_ERROR’ on line 19 at position 3 : SQL compilation error: Object ‘TABLE\_DOES\_NOT\_EXIST’ does not exist or not authorized. |

### Run app service to see which version of the service is running

In the previous section, you simulated a failure when upgrading from version v2, patch 0 to version v2, patch 1.

To determine which version of the service is currently running, run the following command from a worksheet.

Copy code

```
SELECT na_spcs_tutorial_app.core.my_echo_udf('hello');
```

This command returns the following string:

```
Bob said hello
```

Here, you see that since the upgrade failed, the app continues to run the service from v2, patch 0.

However, if you did not include a version initializer in the app, the upgrade process would have upgraded
the service to v2, patch 1 although the app upgrade failed. If an app upgrade fails, the version initializer
ensures that the version of the service does not upgrade and continues to be in sync with the app.

### Review what you learned in this section

In this section, you completed the following tasks:

- Introduced an error in the setup script to simulate an error in the upgrade process.
- Verified the version of both the app and service after the failure.
- Learned how the version initializer ensures that the version of a service is in synch with the version of the app
  when an upgrade fails.

## Create a patch to fix the upgrade error

In the previous section, you introduced an error in the setup script of the app. When you upgraded
the app, you were able to verify that both the app and the service were continuing to run using
version v2 patch 0.

In this section, you modify the setup script of the app to fix the error, create a patch for
the update, and upgrade the app.

### Modify the setup script

To fix the intentional error you introduced in a previous section, remove the following
statement from the `setup_script.yaml` file:

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM table_does_not_exist;
```

### Upload the updated files and create a new patch

To upload the modified setup script to a stage and create a new patch, perform the following tasks:

1. Run the following command to create a new patch for the app:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow app version create v2 --patch 2 -c tut-connection
   ```
2. When prompted, enter `y` to add a new patch to the application package.

### Update the default release directive

In the previous section, you created patch `2` for the app. To set the default
release directive for the patch, run the following command from a worksheet:

Copy code

```
ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE na_spcs_tutorial_pkg
  SET DEFAULT RELEASE DIRECTIVE VERSION=v2 PATCH=2;
```

### Upgrade the app and verify the version of the service

After creating a new version and setting the default release directive, upgrade the
app and test the service by performing the following tasks:

1. To upgrade the app from version `v2` patch `0` to version `v2` patch `2`,
   run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow app run --from-release-directive -c tut-connection
   ```
2. To verify the version of the service that is currently running, run the following
   command from a worksheet:

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT na_spcs_tutorial_app.core.my_echo_udf('hello');
   ```
3. To view the status of the app, including the version that is currently installed,
   run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   DESC APPLICATION na_spcs_tutorial_app;
   ```

   In the output the `version` property is `v2` and the patch property is `2`.

### Review what you learned in this section

Congratulations! You successfully upgraded the app after the upgrade failure.

In this section, you completed the following tasks:

- Fixed the error in the setup script.
- Created a new patch, `p2`, to update the app.
- Upgraded the app to the new patch.

## Tear down the app and objects created in the tutorial

Because the app uses a compute pool, it uses credits in your account
and costs money to run. To stop the app from consuming resources, you must tear down
both the application object and any of the account-level objects it created, such as the
compute pool.

1. To confirm that the compute pool is currently running, run the following command:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow object list compute-pool -l "na_spcs_tutorial_app_%"
   ```

   If the compute pool is running, a row with an `ACTIVE` compute pool that was created by the
   application object is displayed.
2. Run the following Snowflake CLI command to tear down the app:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow app teardown --cascade --force -c tut-connection
   ```

   This command removes all of the Snowflake objects created by the app. Without the `--force` option,
   this command does not drop the application package because it contains versions.
3. To confirm that the compute pool was dropped run the following command again:

   Copy code

   ```
   snow object list compute-pool -l "na_spcs_tutorial_app_%"
   ```

   This command returns `no data` if the compute pool has been dropped successfully.

Note

The `snow app teardown` command drops both the application package and application object.
Therefore, any stateful data is lost.

## Learn more

Congratulations! In this tutorial, you learned how to manually upgrade an app with containers.

### Summary

In this tutorial, you completed the following tasks:

- Added a version initializer stored procedure to handle services during upgrades
  and failures.
- Created a new version definition of the app in the application package. Version
  definitions specify the version number and patch of the app.
- Set the default release directive for an app. Release directives determine which
  version and patch is installed when a consumer installs or upgrades an app.
- Upgraded an app and verified what happens during upgrade failure.
