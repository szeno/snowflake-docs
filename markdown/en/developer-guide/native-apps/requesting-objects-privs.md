# Request access to objects and privileges in a consumer account

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see
[Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](/developer-guide/native-apps/limitations#label-native-apps-supported-clouds).

This topic provides general information about how a provider can develop an app to request
privileges or access to objects in the consumer account when a Snowflake Native App is installed or upgraded.
It provides information on developing an app so that the consumer must manually grant
privileges to the app using Snowsight or SQL. For information on developing an app to use
automated granting of privileges, see [Configure the privileges required by an app](/developer-guide/native-apps/requesting-auto-privs).

## About privileges and references in a Snowflake Native App

In a simple Snowflake Native App, all of the required objects are created inside the
APPLICATION object when the setup script runs during installation. In this context, all of the objects
required by the app are created and accessible within the APPLICATION object. The consumer is not required
to perform any actions. All of the necessary privileges required are managed by the app using
application roles.

However, a more complex Snowflake Native App may need to create new objects or access objects
in the consumer account that are outside the APPLICATION object. In this case, the consumer must
grant the necessary privileges or authorize access to allow the Snowflake Native App to create or access these
objects.

The Snowflake Native App Framework allows providers to do the following:

- Check for account-level privileges in the consumer account.
- Request account-level privileges to perform tasks, for example creating a database.
- Use [references](/sql-reference/references) to access existing objects in the consumer account.

Providers request access to a consumer account by requesting the following:

Global privileges
:   Global privileges allow the Snowflake Native App to perform actions in the consumer account.
    Refer to [Privileges the provider can request from the consumer](/developer-guide/native-apps/requesting-privs#label-native-apps-privs-supported) for details.

References
:   [References](/sql-reference/references) allow the app to access existing objects in the
    consumer account. A provider defines the references that the app requests in the manifest file.

    After installation, the consumer allows access to the object by providing a reference that is created
    with the [fully qualified name](/sql-reference/name-resolution) of the object.

    References allow the app to access objects using a logical name. A reference allows a provider
    to create the app without having to know the specific name of the object or its parent database and
    schema.

    See [references](/sql-reference/references) for more information.

## How a consumer allows access to a Snowflake Native App

For each request for access that a provider defines in the app, the consumer must allow access
to the app. How a consumer allows access is different for global privileges and references.

### Grant global privileges to a Snowflake Native App

When a provider configures an app to request specific privileges or access to specific objects,
there are two ways a consumer can grant these privileges to the app:

- If a provider implements a user interface using the Python Permission SDK, the consumer uses
  Snowsight to grant the permissions that are requested by the app. The Python Permission SDK
  automatically runs the required GRANT statements in the consumer account.
- If a provider does not implement a user interface, the provider must communicate to the consumer
  what privileges the app requires. For example, the provider must communicate to the consumer information
  about the SQL statements that the consumer must run to grant the necessary privileges to the app.

  Snowflake recommends including this information in the README file of the app, which the consumer
  can view as part of listing for the Snowflake Native App.

### Authorize access on objects

When a provider defines a reference to an object in the consumer account that is outside of the
APPLICATION object, there are two ways a consumer can create references on these objects and associate
them to the application.

- If a provider implements a user interface with the Python Permission SDK, the consumer uses Snowsight to
  associate the references to the objects required by the app. See
  [Managing Access Requests using Snowsight](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/native-apps/consumer-granting-privs#managing-access-requests-using-snowsight).
- If a provider does not implement a user interface, the consumer must manually create the reference, then
  associate it with the Snowflake Native App.
