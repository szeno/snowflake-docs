# Add billable events to an application package

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see
[Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](/developer-guide/native-apps/limitations#label-native-apps-supported-clouds).

When you use Custom Event Billing for a Snowflake Native App, you can charge for specific types of application usage in addition to the existing
usage-based pricing plans. To set it up, you must perform two high-level steps:

1. Set up your application package to emit billable events by following the steps in this topic.
2. [Select a usage-based pricing plan with billable events](/collaboration/provider-listings-pricing-model)
   for the listing you use to publish your Snowflake Native App to consumers.

This topic describes how to set up your application package to emit billable events using the [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event) and [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENTS](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_events) system functions.

## Overview of billable events in an application package

You can set up your application package to emit billable events in response to specific usage events so that you can charge consumers based on
how much they use your Snowflake Native App.

For example, you can add a billable event to charge a consumer a specific amount for each call to a stored procedure in your Snowflake Native App.

To add billable events to an application package, do the following:

1. Create stored procedures to define which usage events trigger calls to the
   [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event) and [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENTS](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_events) system functions.

   Note

   You cannot test the output of the system function at this stage. This system function can only be called from a Snowflake Native App
   installed in a consumer account.
2. Add those stored procedures to the setup script of the application package.

Important

Snowflake supports billable events that are emitted by calling the system function within a stored procedure in the application,
as outlined by the examples in this topic.

Snowflake does not support other methods of calculating the base charge for billable events, such as methods that use the output of a
table or user-defined function that outputs consumer activity or methods that use telemetry logged in an event table.

If you’re uncertain whether a proposed implementation will be supported, contact your Snowflake account representative.

## Billable event examples

The examples in this section show how to create stored procedures to emit billable events for common billing
scenarios. Each of these examples calls the `createBillingEvent` function.

### Call the SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT system function

The following example shows how to create a wrapper function in a stored procedure to call the
[SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event) system function.

Note

You can call this system function in a stored procedure written in JavaScript, Python, or Java.

This example creates a JavaScript stored procedure named `custom_event_billing` in the schema version that is accessible to the procedures that emit billing. The stored procedure creates a helper function called `createBillingEvent` which takes arguments that correspond to the typed parameters expected by the SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT system function.

For more details about the parameters and the required types, see [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event).

Copy code

```
 CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE <schema_name>.custom_event_billing()
 RETURNS NULL
 LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
 AS
 $$
   /**
    * Helper method to add a billable event
    * Format timestamps as Unix timestamps in milliseconds
    */

   function createBillingEvent(className, subclassName, startTimestampVal, timestampVal, baseCharge, objects, additionalInfo) {
        try {
            var res = snowflake.createStatement({
            sqlText: `SELECT SYSTEM$CREATE_BILLING_EVENT('${className}',
                                                      '${subclassName}',
                                                      ${startTimestampVal},
                                                      ${timestampVal},
                                                      ${baseCharge},
                                                      '${objects}',
                                                      '${additionalInfo}')`
            }).execute();

            res.next();

            return res.getColumnValue(1);
        } catch(err) {
            return err.message;
        }
    }
$$;
```

The examples in this topic call this helper function.

### Batch multiple billing events with the SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENTS system function

The following example stored procedure shows how to batch multiple Snowflake Native App billing events with the SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENTS system function. By using batches, you save time, reduce the likelihood of exceeding call limits, and ensure your billing events are set up correctly.

For more details about the parameters and the required types, see [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENTS](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_events).

Copy code

```
 CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE <app_provider_db_1><app_provider_schema_1>.external_proc_batch()
 RETURNS STRING
 LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
 EXECUTE AS OWNER
 AS
 $$
   function createBillingEventsBulk(events) {
     try {
       var res = snowflake.execute({
                    sqlText: `call SYSTEM$CREATE_BILLING_EVENTS('${events}')`
                 });
       res.next();
       return res.getColumnValueAsString(1);
     } catch (err) {
       return err.message;
     }
   }

   return createBillingEventsBulk(`
                                   [
                                     {
                                       "class": "class_1",
                                       "subclass": "subclass_1",
                                       "start_timestamp": ${Date.now()},
                                       "timestamp": ${Date.now()},
                                       "base_charge": 6.1,
                                       "objects": "obj1",
                                       "additional_info": "info1"
                                     },
                                     {
                                       "class": "class_2",
                                       "subclass": "subclass_2",
                                       "start_timestamp": ${Date.now()},
                                       "timestamp": ${Date.now()},
                                       "base_charge": 9.1,
                                       "objects": "obj2",
                                       "additional_info": "info2"
                                     }
                                   ]
                                 `);
$$;
```

### Example: Billing based on calls to a stored procedure

The following example shows how to create a stored procedure to emit a billable event when a consumer calls
that stored procedure in a Snowflake Native App.

Add this example code to your setup script in the same stored procedure that defines the helper function:

Copy code

```
...
  //
  // Send a billable event when a stored procedure is called.
  //
  var event_ts = Date.now();
  var billing_quantity = 1.0;
  var base_charge = billing_quantity;
  var objects = "[ \"db_1.public.procedure_1\" ]";
  var retVal = createBillingEvent("PROCEDURE_CALL", "", event_ts, event_ts, base_charge, objects, "");
  // Run the rest of the procedure ...
$$;
```

This example code creates a stored procedure that calls the `createBillingEvent` function to emit a billable event
with the class name `PROCEDURE_CALL` and a base charge of `1.0`.

Note

The types of the arguments passed to the `createBillingEvent` function must correspond to the typed parameters
expected by the [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event) system function.

### Example: Billing based on rows consumed by a Snowflake Native App

The following example shows how to create a stored procedure to emit a billable event based on the number of
rows consumed within a table in the consumer account.

Add this example code to your setup script in the same stored procedure that defines the helper function:

Copy code

```
...
  // Run a query and get the number of rows in the result
  var select_query = "select i from db_1.public.t1";
  res = snowflake.execute ({sqlText: select_query});
  res.next();
  //
  // Send a billable event for rows returned from the select query
  //
  var event_ts = Date.now();
  var billing_quantity = 2.5;
  var base_charge = res.getRowcount() * billing_quantity;
  var objects = "[ \"db_1.public.t1\" ]";
  createBillingEvent("ROWS_CONSUMED", "", event_ts, event_ts, base_charge, objects, "");
  // Run the rest of the procedure ...
$$;
```

This example code creates a stored procedure that calls the `createBillingEvent` function to emit a billable event
with the class name `ROWS_CONSUMED` and a calculated base charge of `2.5` multiplied by the number of rows in the
`db_1.public.t1` table in the consumer account.

Note

The types of the arguments passed to the `createBillingEvent` function must correspond to the typed parameters
expected by the [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event) system function.

### Example: Billing based on the number of rows ingested

The following example shows how to create a stored procedure to emit a billable event based on the number of rows
ingested into a table.

Add this example code to your setup script in the same stored procedure that defines the helper function:

Copy code

```
...
    // Run the merge query
    var merge_query = "MERGE INTO target_table USING source_table ON target_table.i = source_table.i
        WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET target_table.j = source_table.j
        WHEN NOT MATCHED
        THEN INSERT (i, j)
        VALUES (source_table.i, source_table.j)";
    res = snowflake.execute ({sqlText: merge_query});
    res.next();
    // rows ingested = rows inserted + rows updated
    var numRowsIngested = res.getColumnValue(1) + res.getColumnValue(2);

    //
    // Send a billable event for rows changed by the merge query
    //
    var event_ts = Date.now();
    var billing_quantity = 2.5;
    var base_charge = numRowsIngested * billing_quantity;
    var objects = "[ \"db_1.public.target_table\" ]";
    createBillingEvent("ROWS_CHANGED", "", event_ts, event_ts, base_charge, objects, "");
    // Run the rest of the procedure ...
$$;
```

This example code creates a stored procedure that calls the `createBillingEvent` function to emit a billable event
with the class name `ROWS_CHANGED` and a calculated base charge of `2.5` multiplied by the number of rows
ingested in the `db_1.target_table` table.

Note

The types of the arguments passed to the `createBillingEvent` function must correspond to the typed parameters
expected by the [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event) system function.

### Example: Billing based on monthly active rows

Monthly active rows are the number of rows inserted or updated for the first time within a calendar month. Some
providers use this metric to only charge consumers for unique rows updated in a month. You can modify this example to instead
count unique users, or identify a unique data load location to determine a base charge.

The following example shows how to create a stored procedure to emit a billable event based on the number of
monthly active rows. Add this example code to your setup script in the same stored procedure that defines the helper function:

Copy code

```
...
    //
    // Get monthly active rows
    //
    var monthly_active_rows_query = "
     SELECT
         count(*)
     FROM
         source_table
     WHERE
         source_table.i not in
         (
           SELECT
             i
           FROM
             target_table
           WHERE
             updated_on >= DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
         )";
    res = snowflake.execute ({sqlText: monthly_active_rows_query});
    res.next();
    var monthlyActiveRows = parseInt(res.getColumnValue(1));
    //
    // Run the merge query and update the updated_on values for the rows
    //
    var merge_query = "
        MERGE INTO
            target_table
        USING
            source_table
        ON
            target_table.i = source_table.i
        WHEN MATCHED THEN
         UPDATE SET target_table.j = source_table.j
                    ,target_table.updated_on = current_timestamp
        WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
            INSERT (i, j, updated_on) VALUES (source_table.i, source_table.j, current_timestamp)";
    res = snowflake.execute ({sqlText: merge_query});
    res.next();
    //
    // Emit a billable event for monthly active rows changed by the merge query
    //
    var event_ts = Date.now();
    var billing_quantity = 0.02
    var base_charge = monthlyActiveRows * billing_quantity;
    var objects = "[ \"db_1.public.target_table\" ]";
    createBillingEvent("MONTHLY_ACTIVE_ROWS", "", event_ts, event_ts, base_charge, objects, "");
    // Run the rest of the procedure ...
$$;
```

This example code creates a stored procedure that determines the number of monthly active rows using a merge query to identify unique
rows. The example then calculates the base charge using the value of the `monthlyActiveRows` variable and the `billing_quantity`.
The base charge is then passed to the `createBillingEvent` function.

Note

The types of the arguments passed to the `createBillingEvent` function must correspond to the typed parameters
expected by the [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event) system function.

In your setup script, add this stored procedure after the [stored procedure that calls the SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT system function](#label-native-apps-custom-billing-calling-sys-function).

### Snowpark Python example: Billing based on rows consumed

To write your stored procedure in Snowpark Python to bill based on rows consumed by your Snowflake Native App, use the following example:

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE app_schema.billing_event_rows()
   RETURNS STRING
   LANGUAGE PYTHON
   RUNTIME_VERSION = '3.11'
   PACKAGES = ('snowflake-snowpark-python')
   HANDLER = 'run'
   EXECUTE AS OWNER
   AS $$
import time

# Helper method that calls the system function for billing
def createBillingEvent(session, class_name, subclass_name, start_timestamp, timestamp, base_charge, objects, additional_info):
   session.sql(f"SELECT SYSTEM$CREATE_BILLING_EVENT('{class_name}', '{subclass_name}', {start_timestamp}, {timestamp}, {base_charge}, '{objects}', '{additional_info}')").collect()
   return "Success"

# Handler function for the stored procedure
def run(session):
   # insert code to identify monthly active rows and calculate a charge
   try:

      # Run a query to select rows from a table
      query =  "select i from db_1.public.t1"
      res = session.sql(query).collect()

      # Define the price to charge per row
      billing_quantity = 2.5

      # Calculate the base charge based on number of rows in the result
      charge = len(res) * billing_quantity

      # Current time in Unix timestamp (epoch) time in milliseconds
      current_time_epoch = int(time.time() * 1000)

      return createBillingEvent(session, 'ROWS_CONSUMED', '', current_time_epoch, current_time_epoch, charge, '["billing_event_rows"]', '')
   except Exception as ex:
      return "Error " + ex
$$;
```

This example code creates a stored procedure that defines a helper method that calls the SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT system function,
as well as a method that calls that helper method, `createBillingEvent`, to emit a billable event
with the class name `ROWS_CONSUMED` and a base charge calculated by multiplying a price of `2.5` US dollars by the number of rows in
the `db_1.public.t1` table in the consumer account.

Note

The types of the arguments passed to the `createBillingEvent` function must correspond to the typed parameters
expected by the [SYSTEM$CREATE\_BILLING\_EVENT](/sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event) system function.

## Test custom event billing

To make sure that you set up Custom Event Billing properly and that billable events are emitted for usage events as you expect,
do the following:

1. Update your application package:

   1. Update your setup script to include the stored procedures that emit billable events.
   2. Update your application package with the new setup script.
   3. Update the version and release directive for your application package.
2. Share the application package with a consumer account in your organization that you have access to:

   1. [Create a private listing](/collaboration/provider-listings-creating-publishing#label-listings-create).
   2. Add [Custom Event Billing as the pricing plan](/collaboration/provider-listings-pricing-model#label-nativeapps-provider-listings-monetize) for the listing.
   3. Share it with the consumer account.
   4. Sign in to the consumer account using Snowsight.
   5. Install the Snowflake Native App.
3. Confirm that the [stored procedures successfully emit billable events](#label-native-apps-custom-billing-test-billing-sprocs).
4. Confirm that the [listing is set up properly](#label-native-apps-custom-billing-test-pricing-plan).

Note

When you test Custom Event Billing, you must
[set up a payment method](/collaboration/consumer-listings-paying)
but you will not be charged for usage within your organization.

### Validate whether the stored procedures emit billable events

While signed in to the consumer account with which you shared your listing, call the stored procedures that you added to your Snowflake Native App.

For example, to test the stored procedure created for [billing based on monthly active rows](#label-native-apps-custom-billing-monthly-active-rows-ex), do the following:

1. Sign in to the consumer account in Snowsight.
2. Open a worksheet and set the context to `db_1.public`.
3. Run the following SQL statement:

   Copy code

   ```
   CALL merge_procedure()
   ```

   If the stored procedure returns `Success`, your code is working.

Note

If you run these SQL commands in the provider account that you used to create the application package, you see an error.

### Validate the custom event billing pricing plan

To validate the consumer experience of a Snowflake Native App and confirm that the listing and application package are set up properly, you can query
the [MARKETPLACE\_PAID\_USAGE\_DAILY View](/collaboration/views/marketplace-paid-usage-daily-ds) in the DATA\_SHARING\_USAGE schema of the shared SNOWFLAKE database.

Note

Due to latency in the view, run these queries at least two days after first using the Snowflake Native App.

To confirm that billable events are successfully generated by a Snowflake Native App and listing,
run the following SQL statement in the consumer account that you shared the listing with:

Note

Replace the PROVIDER\_ACCOUNT\_NAME and PROVIDER\_ORGANIZATION\_NAME values with those of the provider account.

Copy code

```
SELECT listing_global_name,
   listing_display_name,
   charge_type,
   charge
FROM SNOWFLAKE.DATA_SHARING_USAGE.MARKETPLACE_PAID_USAGE_DAILY
WHERE charge_type='MONETIZABLE_BILLING_EVENTS'
      AND PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME = <account_name>
      AND PROVIDER_ORGANIZATION_NAME= <organization_name>;
```

```
+---------------------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------+
| LISTING_GLOBAL_NAME |  LISTING_DISPLAY_NAME  |        CHARGE_TYPE         | CHARGE |
+---------------------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------+
| AAAA0BBB1CC         | Snowy Mountain Listing | MONETIZABLE_BILLING_EVENTS |   18.6 |
+---------------------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------+
```
