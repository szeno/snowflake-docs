# Set up the containers and services managed by an app

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see
[Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](/developer-guide/native-apps/limitations#label-native-apps-supported-clouds).

The topic describes how to set up the containers and services for a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services.

## Create an image repository

To manage containers with a Snowflake Native App, providers must create an
[image repository](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-registry-repository)
in the provider account to store the images required by the app.

The image repository must exist within a database and schema. The following example shows how to
create an image repository using the [CREATE IMAGE REPOSITORY](/sql-reference/sql/create-image-repository) command.

Copy code

```
CREATE DATABASE provider_db;
CREATE SCHEMA provider_schema;
CREATE IMAGE REPOSITORY provider_repo;
```

Note

Snowflake recommends that providers create the image repository outside the application package.

If the application package is attached to a listing and the listing is configured to use
[Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment](/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment)
an image repository within the application package would be replicated and additional costs incurred.

The images uploaded to this repository are accessible to the application package when adding a version
definition. The app has can only access the images in this repository that are specified in the manifest
file of the application package.

The following consideration apply to image repositories in the context of an app with containers:

- External image repositories are not supported. Image repositories that are outside Snowflake cannot be
  referenced by any services within the container. This is applicable to services that exist in or outside
  of the app.
- Providers cannot directly share an image repository with an app. For example, providers cannot use the
  GRANT TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE command.
- Providers can store multiple container images in an image repository. However, container images that are not
  explicitly listed in the manifest are not accessible by the app in the consumer’s account.
- When a provider adds a version definition to an application package the container images included in that
  version cannot be modified. The images for that version are immutable and persist
  throughout the life cycle of the version. To alter the containers within an app, providers must use a new
  version.

## Upload container images to the image repository

After creating an image repository, providers use Docker commands to upload the container images required
by the app to the image repository. The specific commands required depend on the provider’s environment.
However, the general workflow is:

1. docker login
2. docker build
3. docker tag
4. docker push

The following shows a typical example of how to use these commands:

Copy code

```
$ docker login org-provider-account.registry.snowflakecomputing.com
$ docker build --rm --platform linux/amd64 -t service:1.0 .
$ docker tag service:1.0 org-provider-account.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/provider_db/provider_schema/provider_repo/service:1.0
$ docker push org-provider-account.registry.snowflakecomputing.comprovider_db/provider_schema/provider_repo/service:1.0
```

## Create the service specification file

The service specification is a YAML file that Snowpark Container Services uses to configure and
run a service. See [Service specification reference](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/specification-reference) for
general information on the syntax of this file. See [Create a service from a specification file](/developer-guide/native-apps/container-services#label-native-apps-container-service-create-spec)
for an example of creating a service in the setup script.

The following example shows the fields in the service specification file that are required by
an app with containers.

Copy code

```
spec:
  containers:
  - image: /provider_db/provider_schema/provider_repo/server:prod
    name: server
    ...
  - image: /provider_db/provider_schema/provider_repo/web:1.0
    name: web
    ...
  endpoints:
  - name: invoke
    port: 8000
  - name: ui
    port: 5000
    public: true
```

Note

The service specification file references container images using the original database, schema and
image repository names. During installation or upgrade, a service is created from the service
specification file..

Explicit registry URLs, for example `org-provider.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/db/schema/repo/img:123`
are not supported and result in an error. The location of the image must always a full-qualified
name in the provider account.

## Use a specification template

Providers can also use a [specification template](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services#label-spcs-working-with-services-using-specification-templates)
by adding a reference to a template in the service specification file:

Copy code

```
spec:
  containers:
  - image: /provider_db/provider_schema/provider_repo/server:prod
    name: my_app_container
  endpoints:
  - name: invoke
    port: 8000
  - name: ui
    port: 5000
    public: true
```

See [Create a service with a specification template](/developer-guide/native-apps/container-services#label-native-apps-container-service-create-template) for an example of creating a service in an app using a
specification template.
