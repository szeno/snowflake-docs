# Example - Configure external access for services in an app with containers

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see
[Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](/developer-guide/native-apps/limitations#label-native-apps-supported-clouds).

This topic describes how to grant access to an endpoint that is external to Snowflake in an
app with containers. This example uses external access integrations and secrets to allow access to
the endpoint.

To grant access to an external endpoint in an app with containers, providers must define reference to the
following objects:

- [EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION](/developer-guide/external-network-access/creating-using-external-network-access)

  Defines a list of network rules that specify the domain names of external endpoints. An external access
  integration can also specify a list of secrets that store the credentials used to access these endpoints.
  Secrets are optional and can be set to NONE or ALL.

  In the context of an app with containers, external access integrations require the USAGE privilege.

  Note

  The `multi_valued` property cannot be set to TRUE. Only single-valued references are supported.
- [SECRET](/developer-guide/external-network-access/creating-using-external-network-access#label-creating-using-external-access-integration-secret)
  Contains the credentials required to use the external access integration to connect to an
  external endpoint.

  In the context of an app with containers, secrets support the USAGE and READ privileges. At least one
  of these privileges must be specified. The READ privilege must be specified if the secret is used with
  a service or is attached to a stored procedure or user-defined function.

## Add an external access integration reference to the manifest file

The following example shows how a provider defines an external access integration in the manifest file:

Copy code

```
references:
  ...
  - my_external_access:
      label: "Default External Access Integration"
      description: "This EAI is required to access xyz.com"
      privileges:
        - USAGE
      object_type: EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION
      required_at_setup: true
      register_callback: config.REGISTER_EAI_CALLBACK
      configuration_callback: config.get_config_for_ref
```

This example specifies the following properties, among others, under `references`:

- `my_external_access`: Specifies the name of the external reference.
  - `privileges`: Lists the privileges required by the external access
    integration. In this example, the USAGE privilege is required.
  - `object_type: EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION`: Indicates a reference to an external access integration.
  - `required_at_setup`: Indicates that the consumer must
    authorize access on the object before the app can create the object when set to `true`.
  - `register_callback`: Specifies the callback stored procedure used to register the reference
    with the app.
  - `configuration_callback`: Specifies the configuration callback function for the secret. See
    [Add the configuration\_callback function to the setup script](#label-na-spcs-config-callback) for more information.

## Add a secret reference to the manifest file.

The following example shows how a provider defines a secret in the manifest file:

Copy code

```
references:
 ...
 - consumer_secret:
     label: "Consumer secret"
     description: "Needed to authenticate with an external endpoint"
     privileges:
       - READ
     object_type: SECRET
     register_callback: config.register_my_secret
     configuration_callback: config.get_config_for_ref
```

This example specifies the following properties, among others, under `references`:

- `consumer_secret`: Specifies the name of the reference.
  - `privileges`: Lists the privileges required by the secret. In this example, the READ
    privilege is specified.
  - `object_type: SECRET`: Indicates that the reference is a secret.
  - `register_callback`: Specifies the callback stored procedure used to register the reference
    with the app.
  - `configuration_callback`: Specifies the configuration callback function for the secret. See
    [Add the configuration\_callback function to the setup script](#label-na-spcs-config-callback) for more information.

## Add the configuration\_callback function to the setup script

After adding references for the secret and external access integration, you must add the
`configuration_callback` function to the setup script. To create an external access integration
or secret, the app must be able to determine values for the host port, secret type, the authorization and
token endpoint for OAuth, and so on. The `configuration_callback` function provides this information
from the consumer account to the app.

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CONFIG.GET_CONFIG_FOR_REFERENCE(ref_name STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
BEGIN
 CASE (UPPER(ref_name))
   WHEN 'my_external_access' THEN
     RETURN '{
       "type": "CONFIGURATION",
       "payload":{
         "host_ports":["google.com"],
         "allowed_secrets" : "LIST",
         "secret_references":["CONSUMER_SECRET"]}}';
   WHEN 'consumer_secret' THEN
     RETURN '{
       "type": "CONFIGURATION",
       "payload":{
         "type" : "OAUTH2",
         "security_integration": {
           "oauth_scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly"],
           "oauth_token_endpoint": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
           "oauth_authorization_endpoint":
               "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"}}}';
  END CASE;
  RETURN '';
END;
$$;
```

Snowsight runs this callback procedure to populate the configuration dialog that prompts the user to configure the
required objects.

Note

The `configuration_callback` function is only supported for external access integration and secret objects.

The procedure needs to be granted to an app role for execution as shown in the following example:

Copy code

```
GRANT USAGE ON PROCEDURE CONFIG.GET_CONFIG_FOR_REFERENCE(STRING)
  TO APPLICATION ROLE app_admin;
```

## Best practices when using external access integrations in an app with containers

Snowflake recommends the following best practices when using external access integrations in an app with
containers:

- Any reference to external access integrations that are specified in a [CREATE SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/create-service) or
  [ALTER SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-service) command must be bound before the commands are run in the setup script. These
  commands fail when the reference is not bound.
- Any references to secrets that are specified in the service specification must also be bound before the
  [CREATE SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/create-service) or [ALTER SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-service) commands are run in the setup script.
  These commands fail when the reference is not bound.
- If returning a payload of type ERROR in `configuration_callback` function, providers should return an informative error
  message that helps the consumer understand the cause of the error and how to resolve it. For example:

  - If there is an error in the app
  - If the reference is not required yet
  - If the reference is not ready to be allowed.
- If the `configuration_callback` function contains references with the `required_at_setup` property set to
  TRUE, the `configuration_callback` function must succeed at setup time. In this context, the `configuration_callback` function can’t depend on
  information from the consumer.
- When using a reference to an external access integration with a service, consider creating the service using
  ALLOWED\_AUTHENTICATION\_SECRETS = ALL if the app requires secrets provided by the consumer. This simplifies handling a
  secret within an external access integration.
- If an app only needs to reach specific endpoints and does not require any secrets, use ALLOWED\_AUTHENTICATION\_SECRETS = NONE.
  NONE is the default value. See [CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION](/sql-reference/sql/create-external-access-integration) for more information.
- If the app needs to update a reference, first, unbind the reference, then prompt the consumer to create and bind a new
  object to the reference. A consumer can choose to edit and bind an existing object.
  See [CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION](/sql-reference/sql/create-external-access-integration).
