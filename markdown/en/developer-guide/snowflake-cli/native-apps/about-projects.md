# About Snowflake Native App projects

From the point of view of Snowflake Native App, a project encompasses a codebase that can be added to an application package in a Snowflake account. It includes references to all the extension code that app functionality needs, references to external databases for shared content, as well as required files such as [manifest.yml](/developer-guide/native-apps/manifest-overview), an [environment.yml](/developer-guide/streamlit/app-development/dependency-management#label-streamlit-install-packages-wh-environment-yaml) (for a Streamlit app), and any code artifacts such as JAR files and images. It also includes a configuration to describe how the application package can be built from the files in the project folder.

A Snowflake Native App project is simply a set of files in a directory; like other code repositories, these files can be version-controlled using technologies like git and shared on platforms like Github.

To give you an idea of what a Snowflake Native App project should look like, Snowflake has created a few templates that are available for you to clone through Snowflake CLI commands. You can access these publicly available templates from the [Snowflake Git repository](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-cli-templates) and even create projects directly from them using Snowflake CLI. You can also create and share your own templates. For more information, see [Bootstrapping a project from a template](/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/bootstrap-project/bootstrap).

Caution

Snowflake CLI processes the files inside a project directory. These files can be uploaded to Snowflake by other `snow app` commands, so you should use caution when putting any sensitive information inside files in a project directory.
