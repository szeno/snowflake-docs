## Arguments

None

## Options

`--version TEXT`
:   The version defined in an existing application package from which you want to create an application object. The application object and application package names are determined from the project definition file.

`--patch INTEGER`
:   The patch number under the given *–version* defined in an existing application package that should be used to create an application object. The application object and application package names are determined from the project definition file.

`--from-release-directive`
:   Creates or upgrades an application object to the version and patch specified by the release directive applicable to your Snowflake account. The command fails if no release directive exists for your Snowflake account for a given application package, which is determined from the project definition file. Default: unset. Default: False.

`--channel TEXT`
:   The name of the release channel to use when creating or upgrading an application instance from a release directive. Requires the *–from-release-directive* flag to be set. If unset, the default channel will be used.

:   When enabled, this option displays prompts even if the standard input and output are not terminal devices. Defaults to True in an interactive shell environment, and False otherwise.

`--force`

## Usage notes

Note

This command does not accept a role or warehouse overrides to your `config.toml` file. Please add them to the native app definition in the `snowflake.yml` or `snowflake.local.yml` instead.

This command relies on the resolved project definition to determine the stage to which to upload files, which files to upload, and the name of the objects to create. For guidance on defaults, please refer to [About Snowflake Native App projects](/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/native-apps/about-projects) and [snow init](/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/command-reference/bootstrap-commands/init) usage notes. You can also change them to be according to your own preference, though it is your responsibility to check if there is any clash with existing objects in your account.

- Objects created by Snowflake CLI are tagged with a special comment `GENERATED_BY_SNOWCLI`.
- The role(s) used to create the application package and instance must have the proper account-level privileges to work with Snowflake Native Applications. See [Create and manage an application package](/developer-guide/native-apps/creating-app-package) and [Install and test an app locally](/developer-guide/native-apps/installing-testing-application) for more information.

By default, the `snow app run` command creates an application package in your Snowflake account, uploads code files to its stage, validates the setup script SQL, and then creates (or upgrades) a development-mode instance of that application. You should keep the following in mind when running the default command:

- All files specified under `nativeapp.project.artifacts` in the project definition file(s) are uploaded to the Snowflake stage. This artifact must include a `manifest.yml` file and its related setup script(s).
- All files specified under `nativeapp.project.artifacts` must have already been compiled and packaged separately, if needed, before calling `snow app run`. Snowflake CLI does not offer any feature to perform these intermediate tasks for you, so you have full control over your build process by executing it in your own scripts.
- Snowflake CLI uses default application package name, stage name, and application name when creating those objects.
- Subsequent runs of `snow app run` after the initial one compare the state of your uploaded files to the files in your local directory, and selectively upload only the modified files to save you time. If any files have changed, the application is upgraded based on the new contents of the stage.
- If the application package already exists and its distribution property is `INTERNAL`, the command checks if the package was created by the Snowflake CLI. If it was not, the command throws an error. If the distribution of the application package is `EXTERNAL`, no such check is performed.
- The command warns you if the application package you are working with has a different value for distribution than is set in your resolved project definition, but continues execution.
- The application instance is created or upgraded in [development mode](/developer-guide/native-apps/installing-testing-application#label-native-apps-dev-mode). Specifically, it uses the [staged files](/developer-guide/native-apps/installing-testing-application#label-native-apps-application-creating-stage).

If you specify a `--version`, `--patch` or `--from-release-directive` option, this command upgrades your existing application instance, or creates one if the application does not exist. It does not create an application package in this scenario.

- If Snowflake CLI is not able to update your application for any reason, such as trying to upgrade an application initially installed in loose files mode to use release directives instead, it attempts to drop the existing application and create a new one using the desired installation strategy. The command prompts you to confirm the drop before performing the action.
- If you do not want to interact with the command and instead force all actions, use the `--force` option to bypass all prompts, which proxies as a yes to all the inputs asking whether to proceed with destructive actions.
- Snowflake CLI tries to determine if you are running the commands in an interactive shell. If `--force` is not provided and you are executing commands in the interactive shell, it automatically chooses the interactive option for you.
- If you want to force Snowflake CLI to interact with you even if not in an interactive shell, use the `--interactive` option.

## Examples

These examples assume you have made the necessary changes to your code files and added them to your `snowflake.yml` or `snowflake.local.yml` files.

- If you want to create an application package and an application using staged files, you can execute:

  Copy code

  ```
  cd my_app_project
  my_app_project_build_script.sh
  snow app run --connection="dev"
  ```
- If you already have an application package with a version and a patch, want to create an application from this version and patch, and invoke the interactive mode, you can execute:

  Copy code

  ```
  snow app run --version V1 --patch 12 --interactive --connection="dev"
  ```

  Here, version `V1` and patch `12` are used as an example only.
- If you have an existing release directive set on an application package, want to create an application from it and bypass the interactive mode, you can execute:

  Copy code

  ```
  snow app run --from-release-directive --force --connection="dev"
  ```
- To create an application from the release directive of a non-default release channel, execute:

  Copy code

  ```
  snow app run --from-release-directive --channel ALPHA --connection="dev"
  ```
- This example shows how to pass in multiple environment variables using the `--env` option:

  Copy code

  ```
  snow app run --env source_folder="src/app" --env stage_name=mystage
  ```
