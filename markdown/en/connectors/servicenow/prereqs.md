# Prepare your ServiceNow® instance

Feature — Generally Available

The Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow® is generally available on supported cloud platforms.

Before installing the Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow®, you must set up your ServiceNow® instance. Complete the following steps:

- [ServiceNow® instance access](#servicenow-instance-access) - ensure your ServiceNow® instance is ready for use
- [ServiceNow® user](#servicenow-user) - Ensure the required user is properly configured
- [Set up column indexes for optimized performance](#set-up-column-indexes-for-optimized-performance) - Configure column indices for best performance
- [Optional steps](#optional-steps) - review and perform optional configuration, if required

## ServiceNow® instance access

- Ensure the ServiceNow® instance is publicly available. The connector does not work with instances hidden behind a VPN.
- If you are using [IP Address Access Control](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-security/page/administer/login/task/t_AccessControl.html) for your ServiceNow® instance, you won’t be able to successfully install the connector.
  For more information see [the community article](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Why-Snowflake-doesn-t-share-static-IP-address-with-customer).

## ServiceNow® user

Identify or create the ServiceNow® user for the connector.

To connect to the ServiceNow® instance, the connector must authenticate to the instance as a ServiceNow®
user. Choose a ServiceNow® user that meets the following requirements:

- The username cannot contain a colon (`:`).
- The user must have `read`, `query_match` and `query_range` access to all records in the ServiceNow® tables that
  you plan to ingest. Access control lists (ACLs) should not hide any records in these tables from this user.
- The user must have `read`, `query_match` and `query_range` access to all rows in the following tables in order
  to enable schema detection:

  - `sys_db_object` (with the fields `name`, `super_class`, `sys_id`),
  - `sys_glide_object` (with the fields `name`, `scalar_type`, `sys_id`),
  - `sys_dictionary` (with the fields `element`, `internal_type`, `name`, `sys_id`).
- The user must have `read`, `query_match` and `query_range` access to all rows in the following table in order to
  use the proper ingestion strategy:

  - `sys_table_rotation` (with the `name` and `sys_id` fields).
- The user must have `read`, `query_match` and `query_range` access to the `sys_updated_on` field in the
  below tables in order to not to use less cost-effective “truncate and load” ingestion mode:

  - `sys_db_object`,
  - `sys_glide_object`,
  - `sys_dictionary`,
  - `sys_table_rotation`,
  - journal table (usually `sys_audit_delete`).

Note

Configuring the connection in Snowsight using the OAuth authentication to ServiceNow® is possible only
with [interactive user](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-administration/page/administer/users-and-groups/concept/c_NonInteractiveSessions.html). The ServiceNow® user is interactive if the **Web service access only**
setting is disabled for the user.

You can use the OAuth authentication with non-interactive users only if you configure the connection with SQL commands.
In this case, you cannot log in to ServiceNow® or get the OAuth refresh token using Snowsight.

## Set up column indexes for optimized performance

If you plan to ingest and synchronize a ServiceNow® table that has a `sys_updated_on` field, we recommend setting up
an index on that column. For information on setting up the indexes, see the [Create a Table Index](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-application-development/page/administer/table-administration/task/t_CreateCustomIndex.html) in the ServiceNow® documentation.

After you create the index through the user interface, it may take some time for the index to be constructed.
The indexing process runs as a background task.

If your instance has large tables, Snowflake recommends contacting ServiceNow® customer support to ask
about the best approach to indexing large tables.

## Optional steps

- If you plan to use the OAuth authentication method, and you have the [read-only role](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-administration/page/administer/user-administration/concept/c_ReadOnlyRole.html)
  assigned to your ServiceNow® user, make sure the `glide.security.snc_read_only_role.tables.exempt_create`
  system property has the `oauth_credential` table in its value list.

  Create or edit the `glide.security.snc_read_only_role.tables.exempt_create`
  property in the `sys_properties` table. For more details on editing this property, see [ServiceNow Knowledge Base](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0783404).

  To learn how to add a new system property, see [Add a system property](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-platform-administration/page/administer/reference-pages/reference/r_AvailableSystemProperties.html#t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList) in the ServiceNow® documentation.
- To enable deleted records to be propagated, use the `sys_audit_delete` table as the source of information about deleted records.

  Note

  Please note that the connector must have access to all journal table records or the installation may fail.
  Otherwise record deletions in other tables may not be correct.

  If journal table rows are hidden by ACLs, connector behavior is unpredictable.
  Even if the installation is successful, some deletions may not be correctly synchronized at later points in the process.

  - To use `sys_audit_delete`:

    1. Set the `no_audit_delete` [dictionary attribute](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-application-development/page/administer/reference-pages/concept/c_DictionaryAttributes.html) to `false`.
    2. Make sure that the ServiceNow® user for the connector has access to the `sys_audit_delete` table and
       the `documentkey`, `tablename`, `sys_id`, and `sys_created_on` fields in this table.

    Note

    The connector is only able to synchronize deleted records if they are audited.
    Delete operations that do not call `DBDelete.setWorkflow()` are not ingested in Snowflake.

    Refer to your ServiceNow® product documentation for more information on using `DBDelete.setWorkflow()`.

    Also, note the following about deleted records:

    - Record deletions are not tracked for tables with the `no_audit_delete=true` dictionary attribute.
    - Record deletions from tables with a `sys` prefix are not tracked by default.
    - The connector can only ingest records deleted with cascade record deletion if the reference field is on an
      audited table. Refer to your ServiceNow® product documentation for more information on cascade record deletion.

## Next steps

After completing these procedures, follow the steps in [Install and configure the connector with Snowsight](/connectors/servicenow/installing-snowsight) or [Install and configure the connector with SQL commands](/connectors/servicenow/installing-sql).
