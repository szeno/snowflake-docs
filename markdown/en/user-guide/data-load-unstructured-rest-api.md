# REST API for unstructured data support

This topic describes the REST API used to access staged files.

## `GET /api/files/`

Retrieves (downloads) a data file from an internal or external stage.

### Authentication

Authenticate to the REST API endpoint using OAuth for custom clients. Create a security integration (using
[CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION](/sql-reference/sql/create-security-integration-oauth-snowflake)) to enable an HTTP client that supports OAuth (such as [cURL](https://curl.se/))
to redirect users to an authorization page and generate access tokens for access to the REST API endpoint. For information on configuring
OAuth for custom clients, see [Configure Snowflake OAuth for custom clients](/user-guide/oauth-custom).

### Usage notes

- Send the scoped URL or file URL for a staged file in the GET request.

  - Generate a scoped URL by calling the [BUILD\_SCOPED\_FILE\_URL](/sql-reference/functions/build_scoped_file_url) SQL function.
  - Generate a file URL by calling the [BUILD\_STAGE\_FILE\_URL](/sql-reference/functions/build_stage_file_url) SQL function. Alternatively, query the directory
    table for the stage, if available.
- Authenticate to Snowflake via the Snowflake SQL API using OAuth or key pair authentication. For instructions, see
  [Authenticating to the server](/developer-guide/sql-api/authenticating).
- The authorization to access files differs depending on whether a scoped URL or file URL is sent in the GET request:

  Scoped URL:
  :   Only the user who generated the scoped URL can use the URL to access the referenced file.

  File URL:
  :   Any role that has sufficient privileges on the stage can access the file:

      - External stage: USAGE
      - Internal stage: READ
- An HTTP client that sends a URL (either scoped URL or file URL) to the REST API must be configured to allow redirects.

- If files downloaded from an internal stage are corrupted, verify with the stage creator that `ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE')` is set for the stage.

### Request headers

The following request headers apply to all operations:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | Set this to `Bearer`, followed by the generated OAuth token used to authenticate to Snowflake.  For more information, see [Authenticating to the Server Using OAuth](/developer-guide/sql-api/authenticating#label-sql-api-authenticating-oauth).  For example:  `Authorization: Bearer token` |
| `Accept` | Set this to `*/*`. |
| `User-Agent` | Set this to the name and version of your application (e.g. `applicationName/applicationVersion`). You must use a value that complies with [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3). |
| `X-Snowflake-Authorization-Token-Type` | (Optional) Set this to `OAUTH`.  If you omit the `X-Snowflake-Authorization-Token-Type` header, Snowflake determines the token type by examining the token.  Even though this header is optional, you can choose to specify this header. You can set the header to one of the following values:   - `KEYPAIR_JWT` (for key-pair authentication) - `OAUTH` (for OAuth) - `PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` (for [programmatic access tokens](/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens)) |

### Example

The following Python example issues an HTTP request for client `myApplication` version 1.0:

Copy code

```
import requests
response = requests.get(url,
    headers={
      "User-Agent": "reg-tests",
      "Accept": "*/*",
      "Authorization": """Bearer {}""".format(token)
      },
    allow_redirects=True)
print(response.status_code)
print(response.content)
```
