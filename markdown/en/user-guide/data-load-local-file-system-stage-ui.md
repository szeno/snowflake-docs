# Staging files using Snowsight

With Snowsight, you can create and manage named stages without writing SQL. You can also upload files onto a named internal stage so
that you can view your files, reference the files in a Python worksheet, or
[load data from the files into a table](/user-guide/data-load-web-ui#label-data-load-from-stage-to-table).

You can’t upload files onto user stages or table stages using Snowsight.
For more information about stages, see [Overview of data loading](/user-guide/data-load-overview).

## Creating a stage

You can use Snowsight to create a named internal or external stage.

Note

To create a stage, you must use a role that is granted or inherits the necessary privileges.
For more information, see [Access control requirements](/sql-reference/sql/create-stage#label-create-stage-privileges) for [CREATE STAGE](/sql-reference/sql/create-stage).

### Create a named internal stage

To use Snowsight to create a named internal stage, do the following:

1. sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. at the top of the navigation menu, select [![Add a dashboard tile](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-dashboards-add-tile-icon.png)](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-dashboards-add-tile-icon.png) (**Create**) » **Stage** » **Snowflake Managed**.
3. In the **Create Stage** dialog, enter a **Stage Name**.
4. Select the database and schema where you want to create the stage.
5. Optionally deselect **Directory table**. Directory tables let you see files on the stage, but require a warehouse and thus incur a cost.
   You can choose to deselect this option for now and enable a directory table later.
6. Select the type of **Encryption** supported for all files on your stage. For details, see [encryption for internal stages](/sql-reference/sql/create-stage#label-create-stage-internalstageparams). You can’t change the encryption type after you create the stage.

   > Note
   >
   > To enable data access, use server-side encryption. Otherwise, staged files are client-side
   > encrypted by default and unreadable when downloaded. For more information, see [Server-side encryption for unstructured data access](/user-guide/unstructured-intro#label-file-url-server-side-encryption).
7. Complete the fields to describe your stage. For more information, see [CREATE STAGE](/sql-reference/sql/create-stage).
8. Select **Create**.

### Create a named external stage

To use Snowsight to create a named external stage, do the following:

1. sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. at the top of the navigation menu, select [![Add a dashboard tile](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-dashboards-add-tile-icon.png)](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-dashboards-add-tile-icon.png) (**Create**) » **Stage** » **External Stage**.
3. Select your external cloud storage provider: **Amazon S3**, **Microsoft Azure**, or **Google Cloud Platform**.
4. In the **Create Stage** dialog, enter a **Stage Name**.
5. Select the database and schema where you want to create the stage.
6. Enter the **URL** of your external cloud storage location.
7. If your external storage isn’t public, enable **Authentication** and enter your details. For more information,
   see [CREATE STAGE](/sql-reference/sql/create-stage).
8. Optionally deselect **Directory table**. Directory tables let you see files on the stage,
   but require a warehouse and thus incur a cost. You can choose to deselect this option for now and enable a directory table later.

   > If you enable **Directory table**, optionally select **Enable auto-refresh**, and then select your event notification or
   > notification integration to automatically refresh the directory table when files are added or removed.
   > For more information, see [Data Load Dirtables Auto](data-load-dirtables-auto).
9. If your files are encrypted, enable **Encryption**, and then enter your details.
10. (Optional) To view a generated SQL statement, expand the **SQL Preview**.
    To specify additional options for your stage, such as AUTO\_REFRESH, you can open this SQL preview in a worksheet.
11. Select **Create**.

## Uploading files onto a stage

You can use Snowsight to upload files onto a named internal stage.

To upload files onto an external stage, use the tools provided by your external cloud service
(Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Storage).

### Upload files onto a named internal stage

Note

The maximum file size is 250 MB.

To upload files onto an internal stage, you must use a role that is granted or inherits the USAGE privilege on the database and schema
and the WRITE privilege on the stage. For more information, see [Stage privileges](/user-guide/security-access-control-privileges#label-access-control-privileges-stage).

To upload files onto your stage, do the following:

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Ingestion** » **Add Data**.
3. On the **Add Data** page, select **Load files into a Stage**.
4. In the **Upload Your Files** dialog that appears, select the files that you want to upload. You can upload multiple files at the same time.
5. Select the database schema in which you created the stage, then select the stage.
6. Optionally, select or create a path where you want to save your files within the stage.
7. Select **Upload**.

After you upload files onto the stage, you can take one of the following actions depending on the file:

- Use the files in a Python worksheet. For more information, see [Add a Python File from a Stage to a Worksheet](/developer-guide/snowpark/python/python-worksheets#label-snowsight-py-worksheets-add-py-file).
- Copy data from the staged files into a table. For more information, see [Load data into an existing table using Snowsight](/user-guide/data-load-web-ui#label-data-load-from-stage-to-table) or [Copy data from an internal stage](/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system-copy).
- Query the data in the stage. For more information, see [Query data in staged files](/user-guide/querying-stage).

## Viewing staged files

You can view staged files using Snowsight. You can view files on both internal and external stages.

Note

You must use a role that is granted or inherits the USAGE privilege on the database and schema and the READ privilege on the stage
to perform these steps.

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Catalog** » **Explorer**.
3. Select the database and schema that contain the stage.
4. Select **Stages** and select the stage for which you want to view files.
5. If prompted, select **Enable Directory Table** to enable a directory table for the stage so that you can see files.
6. If prompted, select a warehouse to refresh the directory table.

To refresh the directory table on a stage, select the refresh icon.

## Managing staged files

You can use Snowsight to take the following actions on staged files:

- Select ![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheets-gs-options.png) » **Load into table** to
  [load the file from the stage into a table](/user-guide/data-load-web-ui#label-data-load-from-stage-to-table-snowsight).
- Select ![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheets-gs-options.png) » **Copy path** to copy the path to the file for use elsewhere, such as in a worksheet.

For files on an internal stage, you can also take the following actions:

- Select ![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheets-gs-options.png) » **Download** to download the file from the stage.
- Select ![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheets-gs-options.png) » **Remove** to remove the file from the stage.

Note

To download a file from an external stage, see [Download staged files in Snowsight](/user-guide/unstructured-intro#label-data-unstructured-download-staged-file).

## Managing stages

To manage a stage in Snowsight, do the following:

Note

You must use a role that is granted or inherits the USAGE privilege on the database and schema and the OWNERSHIP privilege on the stage
to perform these steps.

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Catalog** » **Explorer**.
3. Select the database and schema that contain the stage.
4. Select **Stages** and select the stage.
5. Select **Stage Details**.

You can manage the stage in the following ways:

- Select ![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheets-gs-options.png) » **Edit** to edit properties or enable a directory table for the stage object.
- Select ![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheets-gs-options.png) » **Clone** to clone the stage.
- Select ![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheets-gs-options.png) » **Drop** to drop, or remove, the stage.
- Select ![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheets-gs-options.png) » **Transfer Ownership** to transfer OWNERSHIP privileges of the stage to another role.

If you want to manage privileges for the stage, use the **Privileges** section to view, grant, and revoke privileges.

## Troubleshooting

### Files are not visible on an external stage

This issue can occur when an external stage does not have a directory table enabled, or when information about the external storage
location is incorrect.

To fix this issue, try the following:

- Make sure the stage owner has enabled a [directory table](/user-guide/data-load-dirtables) on the stage.
- Check that the directory table has been refreshed.
  To refresh the directory table, select your stage in Snowsight, then select the refresh icon.
- Verify that the cloud provider URL is correct. If your URL contains a subpath, ensure that there is a trailing slash.

### Upload files button is unavailable (inactive)

This issue can occur when you don’t have the required privileges to upload files onto an internal stage,
or if another upload is in progress.

To fix this issue, try the following:

- Make sure that you have selected an internal stage.
- Use a role that is granted or inherits the USAGE privilege on the database and schema and the WRITE privilege on the stage.
- Check whether another upload is in progress. Hovering over the inactive button displays information about any in-progress uploads.
  Snowsight also displays a notification for in-progress uploads. If another upload is in progress,
  it must complete before you can upload additional files onto the stage.
