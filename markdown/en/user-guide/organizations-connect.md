# Connecting to your accounts

This topic provides the URL and [account identifier](/user-guide/admin-account-identifier) formats that you use to connect to the
Snowflake accounts in your organization.

Note

If you are an organization administrator and want to delete old URLs for an account that has changed, see [Managing account URLs](/user-guide/organizations-manage-accounts-urls).

## Connecting to the Snowflake web interface

To connect to Snowsight using your web browser, see [Signing in to Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).

## Connecting with a URL

Snowflake supports multiple URL formats when connecting to a Snowflake account without a browser. For example, an identity provider
might use a direct URL to communicate with Snowflake.

- The **account name** format uses the name of the account and its [organization](/user-guide/organizations) to identify the account.
  To find the name of your organization and account, see [Finding the organization and account name for an account](/user-guide/admin-account-identifier#label-account-name-find).
- The **connection name** format, which replaces the account name with the name of a connection, is required when using the
  [Client Redirect](/user-guide/client-redirect) feature. To find the name of your connection, execute the
  [SHOW CONNECTIONS](/sql-reference/sql/show-connections) command.
- The legacy **account locator** format is currently supported, but its use is discouraged.

### Standard account URLs

The standard URL format can be used in most cases where a Snowflake account URL is required, including:

> - SSO connections ([except Okta](#label-okta-url))
> - SCIM base URL ([except Okta](#label-okta-url))
> - OAuth connections with third-party identity providers ([except Okta](#label-okta-url))
> - OAuth base URL for a Snowflake Authorization Server

The standard URL formats are:

> - Account name: `https://<orgname>-<account_name>.snowflakecomputing.com`
> - Connection name: `https://<orgname>-<connectionname>.snowflakecomputing.com`
> - Account locator (legacy): `https://<accountlocator>.<region>.<cloud>.snowflakecomputing.com`

### Private connectivity URLs

When connecting to Snowflake using private connectivity to the Snowflake service (e.g. AWS PrivateLink), the string `privatelink` must be
appended to the [account identifier](/user-guide/admin-account-identifier) in the Snowflake account URL.

> - Account Name: `https://<orgname>-<account_name>.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com`
> - Connection Name: `https://<orgname>-<connectionname>.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com`
> - Account Locator (legacy): `https://<account_locator>.<region>.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com`

Note that using private connectivity requires updating DNS records to include the private connectivity URL. For more information, see:

> - [AWS PrivateLink CNAME Records](/user-guide/admin-security-privatelink#label-aws-pl-additional-cname-records).
> - Azure Private Link DNS setup in the [configuration procedure](/user-guide/privatelink-azure#label-azure-pl-config-procedure).
> - Google Cloud Private Service Connect DNS setup in [Step 8](/user-guide/private-service-connect-google#label-gcp-psc-config).

### Okta URLs

When using Okta for SSO, SCIM, or OAuth, you must use a special account name format if the account name contains an underscore. Because
Okta does not support underscores in URLs, the underscore in the account name must be converted to a hyphen.

> - Account name: `https://<orgname>-<account-name>.snowflakecomputing.com`
> - Connection name: Use the standard URL
> - Account locator (legacy): Use the standard URL

## Connecting from clients, connectors, and drivers

See [Configuring a client, driver, library, or third-party application to connect to Snowflake](/user-guide/gen-conn-config).

## Backwards compatibility

Using the legacy account locator in an account identifier or account URL is still supported, though discouraged.
