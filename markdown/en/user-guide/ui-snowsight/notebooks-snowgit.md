# Sync notebooks with a Git repository

To use version control with your Snowflake Notebooks, you can sync your notebook development with a branch in a Git repository.

You must have already set up your Snowflake account to be connected to a Git repository and have created a branch in that repository to use
for your notebook development. See [Setting up Snowflake to use Git](/developer-guide/git/git-setting-up).

## Create a notebook from a file in a Git repository

Note

The file must be an `.ipynb` formatted file and it must use notebook format (nbformat) 4.0 or higher.

To create a Snowflake Notebook from a file in a Git repository, do the following:

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Projects** » **Notebooks**.
3. Next to **+ Notebook**, open the drop-down menu and select **Create from repository**.
4. For **File location in repository**, select the repository and branch in the repository that contain the notebook file, then select
   the specific `.ipynb` file. For details on connecting Snowflake to your Git repository, see [Setting up Snowflake to use Git](/developer-guide/git/git-setting-up).
5. For **Notebook location**, select a database and schema to contain the notebook. These cannot be changed after you create the notebook.
6. For **Notebook warehouse**, select a warehouse.
7. Select **Create** to create a Snowflake Notebook from the `.ipynb` file in your Git repository.

## Connect an existing notebook with a Git repository

To connect an existing Snowflake notebook to a Git repository, do the following:

Note

You must use a role with the following privileges at a minimum:

- OWNERSHIP or READ privilege on the Git repository.
- USAGE privilege on the schema that contains the Git repository.

To learn how to connect to your Git repository, see [Setting up Snowflake to use Git](/developer-guide/git/git-setting-up).

> For more details, see [Access control requirements](/sql-reference/sql/show-git-repositories#label-show-git-repositories-access-control).

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Projects** » **Notebooks**, and then open or create a notebook.
3. In the **Files** tab, next to the database object explorer, select **Connect Git Repository**.
4. For **File location in repository**, select the repository and branch in the repository with which you want to sync the notebook.
5. Select **Select Folder**.
6. When you are prompted to commit and push your notebook to the Git repository, complete the Push to Git steps outlined in
   [Push changes to a branch in a Git repository](#label-snowsight-notebooks-git-commit).

   When your notebook is successfully pushed to the Git repository, a new folder is created for your notebook in the selected location in the
   Git repository branch, and all the files and folders in that location are synced back to your notebook. You can select the branch
   name and open the repository details in Snowflake or on Git.

## Push changes to a branch in a Git repository

If a Snowflake Notebook is connected to a branch in a Git repository, after you make changes to the notebook you can push
your changes to the branch.

You must use a role with the OWNERSHIP or WRITE privilege on the Git repository to push your changes.
For more details, see [Access control requirements](/sql-reference/sql/alter-git-repository#label-alter-git-repository-access-control).

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Projects** » **Notebooks**, and then open a notebook.
3. Make any relevant changes to the notebook.
4. Select **Push to Git**.
5. In the **Push to Git** dialog that appears, you can review the username and email address that are used to commit the changes
   to the specified branch and repository. If you need to update the username and email address, expand the **Credentials** section and
   update the **Author name** and **Author email**.
6. For **Commit message**, enter a message to include with your commit.
7. Expand the **Credentials** section to configure credentials. Enter your personal access token for the Git repository in the
   **Personal access token** field. This access token comes from the remote Git provider, such as GitHub.

   - This token is required to authenticate to the Git repository.
   - The token must have read and write access to the content of the repository for the commit to work.
   - Once entered, the token will be saved for future commits. You can update it during any future commits.
8. Select **Push**.

A confirmation message states that your changes were pushed successfully to your branch.

## Sync a notebook with a remote branch in a Git repository

After you connect your notebook to a branch in a Git repository, you can sync any changes in the remote branch with your Snowflake Notebook.

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Projects** » **Notebooks**, and then open or create a notebook.
3. In the database object explorer, in the **Files** tab, select **Pull**.

Snowflake fetches any changes present on the remote repository branch and merges the notebook contents with those changes.

### Merge conflicts

Snowflake attempts to resolve merge conflicts that occur during a sync. If there are merge conflicts that Snowflake isn’t able to
resolve, you will get a message to either discard your changes or commit them to a new branch. When they are committed to a new branch, use
your Git provider to manually merge your changes from the new branch to the original branch. Then you should pull the latest updates into
your Snowflake notebook.
