# Experience Snowflake with Legacy Snowflake Notebooks

Snowflake Notebooks is a development environment that you can use with other Snowflake features. This topic describes ways to leverage other
Snowflake features within notebooks.

## Snowpark Python in notebooks

The [Snowpark library](/developer-guide/snowpark/index) provides an intuitive API for querying and processing data in a data pipeline.
Using the Snowpark library, you can build applications that process data in Snowflake without moving data to the system where your
application code runs. You can also automate data transformation and processing by writing stored procedures and scheduling those
procedures as tasks in Snowflake.

You can use Snowpark to query and process data at scale in Snowflake by writing Snowpark code in a Python cell of your notebook.

### Example usage

Snowpark Python comes pre-installed in the Snowflake Notebooks environment. The following example uses the Snowpark library in a notebook
to read in a CSV file and a Snowflake table and display its contents as output.

1. In your notebook, add a Python cell, either using a [keyboard shortcut](/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-develop-run#label-notebooks-keyboard-shortcuts) or by selecting
   **+ Python**.
   Snowflake Notebooks and Snowpark both support Python 3.9.
2. Set up a Snowpark session.
   In notebooks, the session context variable is preconfigured. You can use the `get_active_session` method to get the session context variable:

   Copy code

   ```
   from snowflake.snowpark.context import get_active_session
   session = get_active_session()
   ```
3. Use Snowpark to load a CSV file into a Snowpark DataFrame from a stage location. This example uses a stage called `tastybyte_stage`.

   Copy code

   ```
   df = session.read.options({"infer_schema":True}).csv('@TASTYBYTE_STAGE/app_order.csv')
   ```
4. Load an existing Snowflake table, `app_order`, into the Snowpark DataFrame.

   Copy code

   ```
   df = session.table("APP_ORDER")
   ```
5. Display the Snowpark DataFrame.

   Copy code

   ```
   df
   ```

Note

Outside of the Snowflake Notebooks environment, you must call `df.show()` to print out the DataFrame. In Snowflake Notebooks,
DataFrames are evaluated eagerly when `df` is printed out. The DataFrame is printed out as an interactive Streamlit DataFrame display
(st.dataframe). DataFrames output is limited to 10,000 rows or 8 MB, whichever is lower.

### Snowpark limitations

- A Snowflake Notebook creates a Snowpark session, so you can use most of the methods available in a Snowpark session class.
  However, because a notebook runs inside Snowflake rather than in your local development environment, you cannot use the following methods:

  - session.add\_import
  - session.add\_packages
  - session.add\_requirements
- Some Snowpark Python operations don’t work with SPROCs. For a complete list of operations, see [Python stored procedure limitations](/developer-guide/stored-procedure/python/procedure-python-limitations).

products, or services that are not owned or provided by Snowflake. Snowflake does not guarantee the accuracy of these examples or
cover them under any Service Level Agreement.

## Streamlit in notebooks

[Streamlit](/developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit) is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share
custom web apps for machine learning and data science. You can build interactive data applications with Streamlit directly in your
notebook. You can test and develop your app directly in a notebook. Streamlit comes preinstalled in notebooks, so you can start quickly.

### Example usage

Streamlit comes pre-installed with the Snowflake Notebooks environment. The example in this section creates an interactive data app using Streamlit.

1. Import necessary libraries

   Copy code

   ```
   import streamlit as st
   import pandas as pd
   ```
2. First create some sample data for the app.

   Copy code

   ```
   species = ["setosa"] * 3 + ["versicolor"] * 3 + ["virginica"] * 3
   measurements = ["sepal_length", "sepal_width", "petal_length"] * 3
   values = [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 6.2, 2.9, 4.3, 7.3, 3.0, 6.3]
   df = pd.DataFrame({"species": species,"measurement": measurements,"value": values})
   df
   ```
3. Set up your interactive slider from the Streamlit library.

   Copy code

   ```
   st.markdown("""# Interactive Filtering with Streamlit! :balloon:
            Values will automatically cascade down the notebook cells""")
   value = st.slider("Move the slider to change the filter value 👇", df.value.min(), df.value.max(), df.value.mean(), step = 0.3 )
   ```
4. Finally, display a filtered table based on the slider value.

   Copy code

   ```
   df[df["value"]>value].sort_values("value")
   ```

You can interact with the app in real time from the notebook. See the filtered table change based on the value you set on the slider.

Tip

For the complete example, see the interactive data app section of the [Visual Data Stories with Snowflake Notebooks](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake-demo-notebooks/blob/main/Visual%20Data%20Stories%20with%20Snowflake%20Notebooks/Visual%20Data%20Stories%20with%20Snowflake%20Notebooks.ipynb) notebook.

### Streamlit support in notebooks

Mapbox and Carto provide map tiles when you use the [st.map](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/charts/st.map) or [st.pydeck\_chart](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/charts/st.pydeck_chart) Streamlit commands.

In warehouse runtimes, which manage their packages with conda, Mapbox and Carto are third-party
applications that are subject to Snowflake’s
[External Offerings Terms](https://www.snowflake.com/legal/external-offering-terms/).

To use these commands in warehouse runtimes, you must acknowledge the External Offerings Terms.
Container runtimes don’t require this acknowledgement.

The following Streamlit elements are not supported in Notebooks:

- [st.set\_page\_config](https://docs.streamlit.io/1.39.0/develop/api-reference/configuration/st.set_page_config)

  > The `page_title`, `page_icon`, and `menu_items` properties of the
  > `st.set_page_config` command are not supported.

## Container Runtime notebooks

Container Runtime provides software and hardware options to support advanced data science and machine learning workloads. For
details on Container Runtime, see [Notebooks on Container Runtime](/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/notebooks-on-spcs).

## Snowflake ML Registry in notebooks

The [Snowflake Model Registry](/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/overview) allows you to securely manage models and your
metadata in Snowflake, regardless of origin. The model registry stores machine learning models as first-class schema-level objects in
Snowflake so they can easily be found and used by others in your organization. You can create registries, and store models in them, using
classes in the Snowpark ML library. Models can have multiple versions, and you can designate a version as the default.

### Example usage

To use the Snowflake ML registry, install the `snowflake-ml-python` library for your notebook:

1. From your notebook, select **Packages** at the top.
2. Search for the **snowflake-ml-python** package and select the library to install it.

Here is an example of how you can use the Snowflake ML Registry to log a model:

Copy code

```
from snowflake.ml.registry import Registry
# Create a registry and log the model
native_registry = Registry(session=session, database_name=db, schema_name=schema)

# Let's first log the very first model we trained
model_ver = native_registry.log_model(
    model_name=model_name,
    version_name='V0',
    model=regressor,
    sample_input_data=X, # to provide the feature schema
)

# Add evaluation metric
model_ver.set_metric(metric_name="mean_abs_pct_err", value=mape)

# Add a description
model_ver.comment = "This is the first iteration of our Diamonds Price Prediction model. It is used for demo purposes."

# Show Models
native_registry.get_model(model_name).show_versions()
```

## pandas on Snowflake in notebooks

[pandas on Snowflake](/developer-guide/snowpark/python/pandas-on-snowflake) lets you run your pandas code in a distributed manner
directly on your data in Snowflake. Just by changing the import statement and a few lines of code, you can get the same familiar pandas-native
experience with the scalability and security benefits of Snowflake.

With pandas on Snowflake, you can work with much larger datasets and avoid the time and expense of porting your pandas pipelines to other
big data frameworks or provisioning large and expensive machines. It runs workloads natively in Snowflake through transpilation to SQL,
enabling it to take advantage of parallelization and the data governance and security benefits of Snowflake.

pandas on Snowflake is delivered through the Snowpark pandas API as part of the Snowpark Python library, which enables scalable data
processing of Python code within the Snowflake platform.

### Example usage

Snowpark pandas is available in Snowpark Python version 1.17 and later. Snowpark Python comes pre-installed with the Snowflake Notebooks environment.

1. To install Modin, select `modin` from **Packages** and ensure that the version is 0.28.1 or later.
2. To set the pandas version, select `pandas` from **Packages** and ensure that the version is 2.2.1.

In a Python cell, import Snowpark Python and Modin:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> import modin.pandas as pd
> import snowflake.snowpark.modin.plugin
> ```

1. Create a Snowpark session:

   Copy code

   ```
   from snowflake.snowpark.context import get_active_session
   session = get_active_session()
   ```
2. Start using the Snowpark Python API:

   Copy code

   ```
   # Create a Snowpark Pandas DataFrame with sample data.
   df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 'Big Bear', 8],[2, 'Big Bear', 10],[3, 'Big Bear', None],
                    [1, 'Tahoe', 3],[2, 'Tahoe', None],[3, 'Tahoe', 13],
                    [1, 'Whistler', None],['Friday', 'Whistler', 40],[3, 'Whistler', 25]],
                    columns=["DAY", "LOCATION", "SNOWFALL"])
   # Drop rows with null values.
   df.dropna()
   # Compute the average daily snowfall across locations.
   df.groupby("LOCATION").mean()["SNOWFALL"]
   ```

## Snowflake Python API in notebooks

The [Snowflake Python API](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/snowflake-python-overview) is a unified library that seamlessly
connects Python with Snowflake workloads. It is intended to provide comprehensive APIs for interacting with Snowflake resources across data
engineering, Snowpark, Snowpark ML, and application workloads using a first-class Python API.

You can use the Snowflake Python API to manage Snowflake resources by creating, deleting, or modifying them, and more. You can use Python
to perform tasks you might otherwise perform with [Snowflake SQL commands](/sql-reference-commands).

In Notebooks, the session context variable is preconfigured. You can use the `get_active_session` method to get the session context variable:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> from snowflake.snowpark.context import get_active_session
> session = get_active_session()
> ```

Create a `Root` object from which to use the Snowflake Python API:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> from snowflake.core import Root
> api_root = Root(session)
> ```

Here is an example of how you can create a database and schema using the Python API:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> # Create a database and schema by running the following cell in the notebook:
> database_ref = api_root.databases.create(Database(name="demo_database"), mode="orreplace")
> schema_ref = database_ref.schemas.create(Schema(name="demo_schema"), mode="orreplace")
> ```
>
