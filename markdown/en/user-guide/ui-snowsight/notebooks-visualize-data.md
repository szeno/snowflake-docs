# Visualize data in Snowflake Notebooks

In Snowflake Notebooks, you can use your favorite Python visualization libraries, such as matplotlib and plotly, to develop your visualizations.

This topic shows how to visualize data in your notebooks using the following libraries:

- [Altair](#label-notebooks-visualize-cells-altair)
- [Matplotlib](#label-notebooks-visualize-cells-matplotlib)
- [Plotly](#label-notebooks-visualize-cells-plotly)
- [Seaborn](#label-notebooks-visualize-cells-seaborn)
- [Streamlit](#label-notebooks-visualize-cells-streamlit)

## The dataset

The examples in this topic use the following toy dataset that is based on the
[Palmer’s Penguin dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html).

| species | measurement | value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| adeli | bill\_length | 37.3 |
| adeli | flipper\_length | 187.1 |
| adeli | bill\_depth | 17.7 |
| chinstrap | bill\_length | 46.6 |
| chinstrap | flipper\_length | 191.7 |
| chinstrap | bill\_depth | 17.6 |
| gentoo | bill\_length | 45.5 |
| gentoo | flipper\_length | 212.7 |
| gentoo | bill\_depth | 14.2 |

You can create this dataset in your notebook with the following code:

Copy code

```
species = ["adelie"] * 3 + ["chinstrap"] * 3 + ["gentoo"] * 3
measurements = ["bill_length", "flipper_length", "bill_depth"] * 3
values = [37.3, 187.1, 17.7, 46.6, 191.7, 17.6, 45.5, 212.7, 14.2]
df = pd.DataFrame({"species": species,"measurement": measurements,"value": values})
df
```

### Visualize results with Altair

Altair is imported by default on Snowflake Notebooks as part of Streamlit. Snowflake Notebooks currently support Altair version 4.0. For details on available
visualization types when using Altair, see [Vega-Altair: Declarative Visualization in Python](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html).

The following code plots a stacked bar chart of all the measurements in a dataframe named `df` that contains the toy dataset:

Copy code

```
import altair as alt
alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x= alt.X("measurement", axis = alt.Axis(labelAngle=0)),
    y="value",
    color="species"
)
```

After you run the cell, the following visualization appears:

### Visualize results with matplotlib

To use matplotlib, install the matplotlib library for your notebook:

1. From the notebook, select **Packages**.
2. Locate the **matplotlib** library and select the library to install it.

The following code plots the toy dataset, `df`, using matplotlib:

Copy code

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pivot_df = pd.pivot_table(data=df, index=['measurement'], columns=['species'], values='value')

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
ax = pivot_df.plot.bar(stacked=True)
ax.set_xticklabels(list(pivot_df.index), rotation=0)
```

After you run the cell, the following visualization appears:

![A stacked bar chart showing the stacked values of each of the measurements for each penguin type.](/static/images/screens/notebooks-matplotlib-viz.png)

For more details on using the `st.pyplot` chart element, see
[st.pyplot](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts/st.pyplot).

### Visualize results with plotly

To use plotly, install the plotly library for your notebook:

1. From the notebook, select **Packages**.
2. Locate the **plotly** library and select the library to install it.

The following code plots a bar chart of the penguin measurements from the toy dataset, `df`:

Copy code

```
import plotly.express as px
px.bar(df, x='measurement', y='value', color='species')
```

After you run the cell, the following visualization appears:

![A stacked bar chart showing the stacked values of each of the measurements for each penguin type.](/static/images/screens/notebooks-plotly-viz.png)

### Visualize results with seaborn

To use seaborn, you must install the seaborn library for your notebook:

1. From the notebook, select **Packages**.
2. Locate the **seaborn** library and select the library to install it.

The following code plots a bar chart of the penguin measurements from the toy dataset, `df`:

Copy code

```
import seaborn as sns

sns.barplot(
    data=df,
    x="measurement", hue="species", y="value",
)
```

After you run the cells, the following visualization appears:

![Bar chart showing each of the measurement values for each penguin type.](/static/images/screens/notebooks-seaborn-viz.png)

For more examples of seaborn visualizations, see the seaborn [Example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html).

### Visualize results using Streamlit

Streamlit is imported by default in Snowflake Notebooks. You can use chart elements supported by Streamlit version 1.39.0 to create a line
chart, bar chart, area chart, or a map with points on it. See [Chart elements](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts) .

Note

Some Streamlit chart elements are not supported in Snowflake or might be subject to additional terms. See [Streamlit support in notebooks](/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-use-with-snowflake#label-notebooks-streamlit-support).

To visualize the toy dataset, `df`, in a bar chart, you can use the following Python code:

Copy code

```
import streamlit as st

st.bar_chart(df, x='measurement', y='value', color='species')
```

After you run both cells, the following visualization appears:

![Bar chart that stacks the penguin measurements for each penguin species.](/static/images/screens/notebooks-streamlit-barchart.png)

To learn more about how you can build interactive data apps with Streamlit, see [Streamlit in notebooks](/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-use-with-snowflake#label-notebooks-streamlit-in-nb).
