# Tutorial: Loading JSON data into a relational table

## Introduction

When uploading JSON data into a table, you have these options:

- Store JSON objects natively in a VARIANT type column (as shown in [Tutorial: Bulk loading from a local file system using COPY](/user-guide/tutorials/data-load-internal-tutorial)).
- Store JSON objects natively in an intermediate table and then use the FLATTEN function to extract JSON elements into separate columns in a table (as shown in [Tutorial: JSON basics for Snowflake](/user-guide/tutorials/json-basics-tutorial)).
- Transform JSON elements directly into table columns as shown in this tutorial.

The COPY command in this tutorial uses a SELECT statement to query for individual elements in a staged JSON file.

The example commands provided in this tutorial include a [PUT](/sql-reference/sql/put) statement.
We recommend executing these commands in SnowSQL which supports the PUT command.
Clients such as [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs) do not support the PUT command.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you need to:

- Download a Snowflake provided JSON data file.
- Create a database, a table, and a virtual warehouse for this tutorial.

Database, table, and virtual warehouse are basic Snowflake objects required for
most Snowflake activities.

### Data file for loading

To download the sample JSON data file, click [sales.json](/static/samples/sales.json).
If clicking the link does not download the file, right-click the link and save the
link/file to your local file system.

The tutorial assumes you unpacked the JSON data file into the following directories:

> - Linux/macOS: `/tmp/load`
> - Windows: `C:\temp\load`

The data file includes sample home sales JSON data. An example JSON object is shown:

Copy code

```
{
   "location": {
      "state_city": "MA-Lexington",
      "zip": "40503"
   },
   "sale_date": "2017-3-5",
   "price": "275836"
}
```

### Creating the database, table, and virtual warehouse

The following commands create objects specifically for use with this tutorial.
When you have completed the tutorial, you can drop the objects.

Copy code

```
 create or replace database mydatabase;

 use schema mydatabase.public;

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE home_sales (
  city STRING,
  zip STRING,
  state STRING,
  type STRING DEFAULT 'Residential',
  sale_date timestamp_ntz,
  price STRING
  );

create or replace warehouse mywarehouse with
  warehouse_size='X-SMALL'
  auto_suspend = 120
  auto_resume = true
  initially_suspended=true;

use warehouse mywarehouse;
```

Note these commands create a temporary table. Temporary tables persist only for
the duration of the user session and are not visible to other users.

## Create file format object

Execute the [CREATE FILE FORMAT](/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format) command
to create the `sf_tut_json_format` file format.

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT sf_tut_json_format
  TYPE = JSON;
```

`TYPE = 'JSON'` indicates the source file format type. CSV is the default file format type.

## Create stage object

Execute [CREATE STAGE](/sql-reference/sql/create-stage) to create the
internal `sf_tut_stage` stage.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY STAGE sf_tut_stage
>  FILE_FORMAT = sf_tut_json_format;
> ```

Similar to temporary tables, temporary stages are automatically dropped
at the end of the session.

## Stage the data file

Execute the [PUT](/sql-reference/sql/put) command to upload the JSON file from your local file system to the
named stage.

- Linux or macOS

  Copy code

  ```
  PUT file:///tmp/load/sales.json @sf_tut_stage AUTO_COMPRESS=TRUE;
  ```
- Windows

  Copy code

  ```
  PUT file://C:\temp\load\sales.json @sf_tut_stage AUTO_COMPRESS=TRUE;
  ```

## Copy data into the target table

Load the `sales.json.gz` staged data file into the `home_sales` table.

Copy code

```
COPY INTO home_sales(city, state, zip, sale_date, price)
   FROM (SELECT SUBSTR($1:location.state_city,4),
                SUBSTR($1:location.state_city,1,2),
                $1:location.zip,
                to_timestamp_ntz($1:sale_date),
                $1:price
         FROM @sf_tut_stage/sales.json.gz t)
   ON_ERROR = 'continue';
```

Note the $1 in the SELECT query refers to the single column where the JSON is stored.
The query also uses the following functions:

- The [SUBSTR , SUBSTRING](/sql-reference/functions/substr) function to extract city and state values from the state\_city JSON key.
- The [TO\_TIMESTAMP / TO\_TIMESTAMP\_\*](/sql-reference/functions/to_timestamp) function to cast the sale\_date JSON key value to a timestamp.

Execute the following query to verify data is copied.

Copy code

```
SELECT * from home_sales;
```

## Remove the successfully copied data files

After you verify that you successfully copied data from your stage into the tables,
you can remove data files from the internal stage using the [REMOVE](/sql-reference/sql/remove)
command to save on [data storage](/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute).

> Copy code
>
> ```
> REMOVE @sf_tut_stage/sales.json.gz;
> ```

## Clean up

Execute the following [DROP <object>](/sql-reference/sql/drop) commands to return your system to its state before you began the tutorial:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS mydatabase;
> DROP WAREHOUSE IF EXISTS mywarehouse;
> ```

Dropping the database automatically removes all child database objects such as tables.
