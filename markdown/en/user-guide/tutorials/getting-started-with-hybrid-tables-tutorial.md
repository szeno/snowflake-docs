# Getting started with hybrid tables

## Introduction

A [hybrid table](/user-guide/tables-hybrid) is a Snowflake table type that is optimized for
hybrid transactional and analytic workloads. These workloads require low latency and high throughput on
small but random reads and writes, which often access a single row in a table. Hybrid tables enforce unique
and referential integrity constraints, which are critical for transactional workloads.

You can use a hybrid table along with other Snowflake tables and features to power
[Unistore workloads](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/unistore/),
which unite transactional and analytic data in a single platform.

Hybrid tables are integrated seamlessly into the existing Snowflake architecture. Customers connect to the
same Snowflake database service. Queries are compiled and optimized in the cloud services layer and
executed in the same query engine in virtual warehouses. This architecture provides several key benefits:

- Snowflake platform features, such as data governance, work with hybrid tables out of the box.
- You can run hybrid workloads that mix operational and analytic queries.
- You can join hybrid tables with other Snowflake tables, and the query executes natively and efficiently in the
  same query engine. No federation is required.
- You can execute an atomic transaction across hybrid tables and other Snowflake tables. There is no need to
  orchestrate your own two-phase commit.

![Unistore architecture](/static/images/unistore-arch.png)

Hybrid tables leverage a row store as the primary data store to provide excellent operational query performance.
When you write to a hybrid table, the data is written directly into the row store. Data is asynchronously copied
into object storage in order to provide better performance and workload isolation for large scans without affecting
ongoing operational workloads. Some data may also be cached in columnar format on your warehouse in order to provide
better performance on analytical queries. You simply execute SQL statements against the logical hybrid table, and the
query optimizer decides where to read data from to provide the best performance. You get one consistent view of your data
without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

### What you will learn

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

- Create and bulk load hybrid tables.
- Create and check the enforcement of UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, and FOREIGN KEY constraints.
- Run concurrent updates that depend on row-level locks.
- Run a multi-statement operation in a consistent atomic transaction (across hybrid and standard tables).
- Query hybrid tables and join them to standard tables.
- Verify that security and governance principles apply to both hybrid and standard tables.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you are:

- Familiar with the Snowsight interface
- Familiar with SQL
- Using a non-trial Snowflake account in [select AWS regions](/user-guide/tables-hybrid-limitations#label-hybrid-tables-limitations)
- Able to run as a user who has been granted the ACCOUNTADMIN role
- Aware of [unsupported features and limitations on hybrid tables](/user-guide/tables-hybrid-limitations)

## Step 1. Set up your account

To get started, set up your Snowflake account by creating a new worksheet, a role, database objects, and a virtual warehouse.
Then you will be able to create two hybrid tables and one standard table. Follow these steps:

1. Under **Worksheets**, click the **+** button in the top-right corner of Snowsight and select **SQL Worksheet**.
2. Rename the worksheet by selecting its auto-generated timestamp name and typing `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart`.
3. Complete the following steps by copying the block of SQL commands into your worksheet and running them all.

   1. Use the ACCOUNTADMIN role to create the `hybrid_quickstart_role` custom role, then grant this role to the current user.
   2. Create the `hybrid_quickstart_wh` warehouse and the `hybrid_quickstart_db` database. Grant ownership on these
      objects to the new role.
   3. Use the new role to create the `data` schema.
   4. Use the new warehouse. (The database and schema you created are already in use, by default.)

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
   CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;
   SET my_user = CURRENT_USER();
   GRANT ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role TO USER IDENTIFIER($my_user);

   CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE hybrid_quickstart_wh WAREHOUSE_SIZE = XSMALL, AUTO_SUSPEND = 300, AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;
   GRANT OWNERSHIP ON WAREHOUSE hybrid_quickstart_wh TO ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;
   CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE hybrid_quickstart_db;
   GRANT OWNERSHIP ON DATABASE hybrid_quickstart_db TO ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;

   USE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;
   CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA data;

   USE WAREHOUSE hybrid_quickstart_wh;
   ```

## Step 2. Create and bulk load three tables

This tutorial uses the Tasty Bytes Snowflake fictional food truck business to simulate a use case where you can
serve data to an application.

You will create three tables:

- `order_header` hybrid table - This table stores order metadata such as `truck_id`, `customer_id`,
  `order_amount`, and so on.
- `truck` hybrid table - This table stores truck metadata such as `truck_id`, `franchise_id`, `menu_type_id`,
  and so on.
- `truck_history` standard table - This table stores historical information about food trucks, enabling you to
  track changes over time.

You are creating hybrid and standard tables to demonstrate how well they work together. Nonetheless, hybrid tables
have some fundamental differences in their definition and behavior:

- Hybrid tables require a primary key on one or more columns (which implies the creation of a primary key index).
- Hybrid tables allow the creation of [secondary indexes](/user-guide/tables-hybrid-index#label-add-secondary-indexes) on any column.
- PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and UNIQUE [constraints](/sql-reference/constraints-overview) are all enforced on hybrid tables.
- Locks on hybrid tables are [row-level](/sql-reference/transactions#label-txn-locking), not table-level.
- Hybrid table data resides in a row store, but is also copied to columnar object storage.

These differences result in:

- Support for referential integrity when table data is loaded, updated, or deleted.
- Faster DML operations (especially those that update single rows).
- Faster lookup queries.

You can bulk load data into hybrid tables by copying data from a stage or from other tables (that is, by using
[CTAS](/sql-reference/sql/create-table#label-ctas-syntax), [COPY INTO <table>](/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table), or
[INSERT INTO … SELECT](/sql-reference/sql/insert)). This tutorial uses the CTAS command. For more
information about bulk loading hybrid tables, see [Loading data](/user-guide/tables-hybrid-create#label-create-loading-data).

Create a [file format](/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format), which describes a staged data set
that you can access or load into Snowflake tables, and a [stage](/user-guide/data-load-overview), which is a Snowflake object
that points to a cloud storage location that Snowflake can access to both ingest and query data. The
data is stored in a publicly accessible AWS S3 bucket that you reference when you create the stage.

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT csv_format TYPE = CSV FIELD_DELIMITER = ',' SKIP_HEADER = 1 NULL_IF = ('NULL', 'null') EMPTY_FIELD_AS_NULL = true;
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE frostbyte_tasty_bytes_stage URL = 's3://sfquickstarts/hybrid_table_guide' FILE_FORMAT = csv_format;
```

Now use the [LIST](/sql-reference/sql/list) statement to return all the files in the FROSTBYTE\_TASTY\_BYTES\_STAGE:

Copy code

```
LIST @frostbyte_tasty_bytes_stage;
```

The statement should return two records: one for the `TRUCK.csv` file and one for the `ORDER_HEADER.csv` file.

![Output of LIST command, with names and sizes of two files.](/static/images/screens/list_tasty_bytes_stage.png)

After you have created the stage, which points to the location of the data in cloud storage, you can create and load the data into the
`truck` by using a [CTAS command](/sql-reference/sql/create-hybrid-table) that selects data from the `TRUCK.csv` file.
Note the PRIMARY KEY constraint on the `truck_id` column.

The second DDL statement creates a standard table named `truck_history`, also by using a CTAS statement.

Copy code

```
SET CURRENT_TIMESTAMP = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();

CREATE OR REPLACE HYBRID TABLE truck (
  truck_id NUMBER(38,0) NOT NULL,

      CONCAT(truck_id, '_truck@email.com') truck_email,
      $CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS record_start_time
    FROM @FROSTBYTE_TASTY_BYTES_STAGE (PATTERN=>'.*TRUCK.csv') t;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE truck_history (

      CONCAT(truck_id, '_truck@email.com') truck_email,
      $CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS record_start_time,
      NULL AS record_end_time
   FROM @frostbyte_tasty_bytes_stage (PATTERN=>'.*TRUCK.csv') t;
```

The following DDL statement creates the structure for the `order_header` hybrid table.
Note the PRIMARY KEY constraint on the `order_id` column, the FOREIGN KEY constraint on the
`truck_id` column from the `truck` table, and the secondary index on the `order_ts` column.

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE HYBRID TABLE order_header (
  order_id NUMBER(38,0) NOT NULL,
  truck_id NUMBER(38,0),
  location_id NUMBER(19,0),
  customer_id NUMBER(38,0),
  discount_id FLOAT,
  shift_id NUMBER(38,0),
  shift_start_time TIME(9),
  shift_end_time TIME(9),
  order_channel VARCHAR(16777216),
  order_ts TIMESTAMP_NTZ(9),
  served_ts VARCHAR(16777216),
  order_currency VARCHAR(3),
  order_amount NUMBER(38,4),
  order_tax_amount VARCHAR(16777216),
  order_discount_amount VARCHAR(16777216),

  order_status VARCHAR(16777216) DEFAULT 'INQUEUE',
  PRIMARY KEY (order_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (truck_id) REFERENCES TRUCK(truck_id),
  INDEX IDX01_ORDER_TS(order_ts)
);
```

The following DML statement inserts data into the `order_header` table, using an INSERT INTO … SELECT statement.

Copy code

```
INSERT INTO order_header (
  order_id,
  truck_id,
  location_id,
  customer_id,
  discount_id,
  shift_id,
  shift_start_time,
  shift_end_time,
  order_channel,
  order_ts,
  served_ts,
  order_currency,
  order_amount,
  order_tax_amount,
  order_discount_amount,
  order_total,
  order_status)
  SELECT
      t.$1 AS order_id,
      t.$2 AS truck_id,
      t.$3 AS location_id,
      t.$4 AS customer_id,
      t.$5 AS discount_id,
      t.$6 AS shift_id,
      t.$7 AS shift_start_time,
      t.$8 AS shift_end_time,
      t.$9 AS order_channel,
      t.$10 AS order_ts,

      t.$12 AS order_currency,
      t.$13 AS order_amount,
      t.$14 AS order_tax_amount,
      t.$15 AS order_discount_amount,
      t.$16 AS order_total,
      '' as order_status
    FROM @frostbyte_tasty_bytes_stage (PATTERN=>'.*ORDER_HEADER.csv') t;
```

## Step 3. Explore your data

Earlier you created the `hybrid_quickstart_role` role, `hybrid_quickstart_wh` warehouse, `hybrid_quickstart_db` database,
and `data` schema. Continue to use those objects.

You also created and loaded the `truck`, `truck_history`, and `order_header` tables. Now you can run a few queries and become familiar with both the data in these tables and their metadata.

Use the [SHOW TABLES](/sql-reference/sql/show-tables) command to view properties and metadata for both standard tables and
hybrid tables. Use the [SHOW HYBRID TABLES](/sql-reference/sql/show-hybrid-tables) command to view information about hybrid tables only.

Copy code

```
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%truck%';
```

![Output of SHOW TABLES command for the truck table](/static/images/screens/show_tables_like_truck.png)

Copy code

```
SHOW HYBRID TABLES LIKE '%order_header%';
```

![Output of SHOW HYBRID TABLES command for the order_header table](/static/images/screens/show_hybrid_tables_like_order_header.png)

Display information about the columns in the table by using [DESCRIBE <object>](/sql-reference/sql/desc) commands. Note the columns with
PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints.

Copy code

```
DESCRIBE TABLE truck;
```

![Output of DESCRIBE command for the truck table](/static/images/screens/describe_table_truck.png)

Copy code

```
DESCRIBE TABLE order_header;
```

![Output of DESCRIBE command for the order_header table](/static/images/screens/describe_table_order_header.png)

List the [hybrid tables](/sql-reference/sql/show-hybrid-tables) for which you have access privileges.

Copy code

```
SHOW HYBRID TABLES;
```

![Output of SHOW HYBRID TABLES command](/static/images/screens/show_hybrid_tables.png)

List all the [indexes](/sql-reference/sql/show-indexes) for which you have access privileges. Note the value in the
`is_unique` column for each index.

Copy code

```
SHOW INDEXES;
```

![Output of SHOW INDEXES command](/static/images/screens/show_indexes.png)

Look at sample data from the tables by running these simple queries.

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM truck LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM truck_history LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM order_header LIMIT 10;
```

The output for the first query looks similar to the following:

![Output of SELECT query against truck table](/static/images/screens/select_from_truck.png)

## Step 4. Test the behavior of UNIQUE and FOREIGN KEY constraints

In this step, you will test UNIQUE and FOREIGN KEY [constraints](/sql-reference/constraints-overview).
These constraints are enforced when they are defined on hybrid tables.

UNIQUE constraints preserve data integrity by preventing duplicate values from being inserted into a
column. FOREIGN KEY constraints work in tandem with PRIMARY KEY constraints to preserve referential integrity. A value
cannot be inserted into a primary key column if no matching foreign key value exists in the referenced table.
For example, a sale of a product with ID `100` cannot be recorded in a sales fact table if no such product ID
already exists in a referenced product dimension table.

Both types of constraints support data accuracy and consistency for applications that rely heavily on reliable
but fast transaction processing.

### Step 4.1. Test a UNIQUE constraint

A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. In the `truck` table, you
defined the `truck_email` column as NOT NULL and UNIQUE.

Given the UNIQUE constraint, if you attempt to insert two records with
the same email address, the statement will fail. To test this behavior, run the following commands.

Start by selecting an existing email address and setting a variable `truck_email` to that string. Then select the
maximum value of `truck_id` from the table and set another variable `max_truck_id` to that value. Next, set a third
variable, `new_truck_id` that increments `max_truck_id` by 1. This process ensures that you do not run into a
“Primary key already exists” error when you insert a new row.

Finally, insert the new row.

Copy code

```
SET truck_email = (SELECT truck_email FROM truck LIMIT 1);
SET max_truck_id = (SELECT MAX(truck_id) FROM truck);
SET new_truck_id = $max_truck_id+1;
INSERT INTO truck VALUES
  ($new_truck_id,2,'Stockholm','Stockholm län','Stockholm','Sweden','SE',1,2001,'Freightliner','MT45 Utilimaster',0,276,'2020-10-01',$truck_email,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
```

The INSERT statement fails and you receive the following error message:

```
Duplicate key value violates unique constraint SYS_INDEX_TRUCK_UNIQUE_TRUCK_EMAIL
```

Now create a new unique email address and insert a new record into the `truck` table:

Copy code

```
SET new_unique_email = CONCAT($new_truck_id, '_truck@email.com');
INSERT INTO truck VALUES ($new_truck_id,2,'Stockholm','Stockholm län','Stockholm','Sweden','SE',1,2001,'Freightliner','MT45 Utilimaster',0,276,'2020-10-01',$new_unique_email,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
```

The INSERT statement should run successfully this time.

### Step 4.2. Test a FOREIGN KEY constraint

In this step you will test a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

First, show the DDL that you used to create the `order_header` table by executing the
[GET\_DDL](/sql-reference/functions/get_ddl) function. Note the FOREIGN KEY constraint for the `truck_id` column in the output.

Copy code

```
SELECT GET_DDL('table', 'order_header');
```

The output of this command looks similar to the following partial result:

![Output of get_ddl on order_header table](/static/images/screens/select_getddl_order_header.png)

Now try to insert a new record into the `order_header` table, using a non-existent truck ID.

Copy code

```
SET max_order_id = (SELECT MAX(order_id) FROM order_header);
SET new_order_id = ($max_order_id +1);
SET no_such_truck_id = -1;
INSERT INTO order_header VALUES
  ($new_order_id,$no_such_truck_id,6090,0,0,0,'16:00:00','23:00:00','','2022-02-18 21:38:46.000','','USD',17.0000,'','',17.0000,'');
```

The INSERT statement should fail because it violates the FOREIGN KEY constraint on the `truck` table. You should receive
the following error message:

```
Foreign key constraint SYS_INDEX_ORDER_HEADER_FOREIGN_KEY_TRUCK_ID_TRUCK_TRUCK_ID was violated.
```

Now use the new `new_truck_id` variable that you used earlier and insert a new record into the `order_header` table:

Copy code

```
INSERT INTO order_header VALUES
  ($new_order_id,$new_truck_id,6090,0,0,0,'16:00:00','23:00:00','','2022-02-18 21:38:46.000','','USD',17.0000,'','',17.0000,'');
```

The INSERT statement should run successfully this time.

### Step 4.3. Attempt to truncate a table referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint

Next, you can verify that a table referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint cannot be truncated as long as the foreign-key relationship
exists. Run the following [TRUNCATE TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/truncate-table) statement:

Copy code

```
TRUNCATE TABLE truck;
```

The statement should fail, and you should receive the following error message:

```
391458 (0A000): Hybrid table 'TRUCK' cannot be truncated because it is involved in active foreign key constraints.
```

### Step 4.4. Delete a row referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint

Next, you can verify that a record referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint cannot be deleted as long as the foreign-key
relationship exists. Run the following [DELETE](/sql-reference/sql/delete) statement.

Copy code

```
DELETE FROM truck WHERE truck_id = $new_truck_id;
```

The statement should fail, and you should receive the following error message:

```
Foreign keys that reference key values still exist.
```

To delete a record referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint, you must first delete the corresponding record from the
`order_header` table. Then you can delete the referenced record from the `truck` table. Run the following DELETE
statements:

Copy code

```
DELETE FROM order_header WHERE order_id = $new_order_id;
DELETE FROM truck WHERE truck_id = $new_truck_id;
```

Both statements should run successfully.

## Step 5. Use row-level locking to run concurrent updates

Unlike standard tables, which use partition or table-level locking, hybrid tables employ
[row-level locking](/sql-reference/transactions#label-txn-locking) for
update operations. Row-level locking allows concurrent updates on independent records so that transactions don’t
wait on full table locks. For applications that rely on heavy transactional workloads,
wait times for locks must be kept to a minimum, allowing concurrent operations to access the same table very frequently.

In this step, you can test concurrent updates to different records in the `order_header` hybrid table.

You will use the main `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart` worksheet that you created earlier, and you will create a new worksheet named `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart Session 2` to simulate a new session. From the `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart`
worksheet, you will start a new transaction by using the [BEGIN](/sql-reference/sql/begin)
statement, then run an UPDATE statement (a DML operation). Before running the [COMMIT](/sql-reference/sql/commit)
transaction statement, you will open the `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart Session 2` worksheet and run another UPDATE statement.
Finally, you will commit the open transaction.

### Step 5.1. Create a new worksheet

Under **Worksheets**, click the **+** button in the top-right corner of
Snowsight, then select **SQL Worksheet**.

Rename the worksheet by selecting its auto-generated timestamp name and typing `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart Session 2`.
This new worksheet will only be used in the current step.

### Step 5.2. Run concurrent updates

First, open the `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart` worksheet. Make sure you are using the right role, warehouse, database, and
schema, then set and select the `max_order_id` variable.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;
USE WAREHOUSE hybrid_quickstart_wh;
USE DATABASE hybrid_quickstart_db;
USE SCHEMA data;

SET max_order_id = (SELECT MAX(order_id) FROM order_header);
SELECT $max_order_id;
```

Note the value of the `max_order_id` variable.

Start a new transaction and run the first UPDATE statement.

Copy code

```
BEGIN;
UPDATE order_header
  SET order_status = 'COMPLETED'
  WHERE order_id = $max_order_id;
```

Note that you did not commit the transaction, so now there is an open lock on the row that matches this condition:

Copy code

```
WHERE order_id = $max_order_id
```

Run the [SHOW TRANSACTIONS](/sql-reference/sql/show-transactions) command, which should return a single open transaction.

Copy code

```
SHOW TRANSACTIONS;
```

The output of this command looks similar to the following partial result:

![Output of SHOW TRANSACTIONS command, showing one open transaction](/static/images/screens/show_one_open_transaction.png)

Open the `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart Session 2` worksheet. Make sure you are using the right role, warehouse, database, and schema, then set and select the `min_order_id` variable.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;
USE WAREHOUSE hybrid_quickstart_wh;
USE DATABASE hybrid_quickstart_db;
USE SCHEMA data;
```

Copy code

```
SET min_order_id = (SELECT MIN(order_id) FROM order_header);
SELECT $min_order_id;
```

Note that the `min_order_id` value is different from the `max_order_id` value that you used in the first UPDATE statement.
Run the second UPDATE statement.

Copy code

```
UPDATE order_header
  SET order_status = 'COMPLETED'
  WHERE order_id = $min_order_id;
```

Because hybrid tables use row-level locking and the open transaction locks the row `WHERE order_id = $MAX_ORDER_ID`,
the UPDATE statement runs successfully.

Open the `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart` worksheet and commit the open transaction.

Copy code

```
COMMIT;
```

Run the following query to view the updated records:

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM order_header WHERE order_status = 'COMPLETED';
```

The output of this command looks similar to the following partial result:

![SELECT result from order_header table where order_status is completed](/static/images/screens/select_order_header_where_completed.png)

## Step 6. Demonstrate consistency

In this step, you will learn about a unique hybrid tables feature: the ability to run multi-statement
operations natively, easily, and effectively in one consistent atomic transaction, with access to both hybrid
tables and standard tables. Snowflake [transactions](/sql-reference/transactions) guarantee the “ACID”
properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. Any given transaction is treated as an atomic unit;
preserves a consistent database state when writes occur; is isolated from other concurrent transactions (as if they
were being run sequentially); and is committed durably (remains committed, once committed).

In this example, the company acquires a new truck of the same model as an existing truck. Consequently, you must
update the `year` column for the relevant record in the `truck` hybrid table to reflect the change.
After this update, you need to promptly update a row and insert a new row in the `truck_history` table. This
standard table will track and preserve all the changes to the truck fleet over time. You complete all of these steps
as part of one explicitly committed transaction.

### Step 6.1. Run a single transaction that contains multiple DML statements

Open the original `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart` worksheet.

Start a new transaction to ensure that a subsequent series of operations is treated as a single, atomic unit. Then
execute multiple DML statements:

- Update the relevant truck record in the `truck` hybrid table.
- Update the corresponding record in the `truck_history` table by setting the `record_end_time` to mark the end of
  its validity.
- Insert a new record in the `truck_history` table, capturing the updated information.

Finally, commit the transaction.

Copy code

```
BEGIN;
SET CURRENT_TIMESTAMP = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();
UPDATE truck SET year = '2024', record_start_time=$CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE truck_id = 1;
UPDATE truck_history SET record_end_time=$CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE truck_id = 1 AND record_end_time IS NULL;
INSERT INTO truck_history SELECT *, NULL AS record_end_time FROM truck WHERE truck_id = 1;
COMMIT;
```

### Step 6.2. Check the results

Now run the following SELECT queries to review the results of the UPDATE and INSERT statements.

The first query should return two rows, and the second query should return one.

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM truck_history WHERE truck_id = 1;
```

The output of this command looks similar to the following partial result:

![Output of truck_history query that returns two rows](/static/images/screens/select_where_truck_history_id.png)

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM truck WHERE truck_id = 1;
```

The output of this command looks similar to the following partial result:

![Output of truck query that returns one row](/static/images/screens/select_where_truck_id.png)

## Step 7. Join a hybrid table to a standard table

In this step, you run a [join](/sql-reference/constructs/join) query that combines data from a hybrid table
(`order_header`) and a standard table (`truck_history`). This query demonstrates the interoperability of the two
table types.

### Step 7.1. Explore the data in the tables

Earlier you created and loaded the `order_header` table. Now you can run a few queries and review some
information to get familiar with the table. First, list the tables in the database with the SHOW TABLES command,
then select two columns from the output of that list.

Copy code

```
SHOW TABLES IN DATABASE hybrid_quickstart_db;
SELECT "name", "is_hybrid" FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(last_query_id()));
```

The output of this command looks similar to the following partial result:

![Query that shows whether tables are hybrid](/static/images/screens/show_tables_is_hybrid.png)

Now run two simple queries:

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM truck_history LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM order_header LIMIT 10;
```

The output of the second query looks similar to the following partial result:

![Query that returns 10 rows from the order_header table](/static/images/screens/select_from_order_header_limit.png)

### Step 7.2. Join a hybrid table to a standard table

To join the `order_header` hybrid table to the `truck_history` standard table, run the following
SET statement and query. Joining hybrid tables to standard tables does not require any special syntax.

Copy code

```
SET order_id = (SELECT order_id FROM order_header LIMIT 1);

SELECT hy.*,st.*
  FROM order_header AS hy JOIN truck_history AS st ON hy.truck_id = st.truck_id
  WHERE hy.order_id = $order_id
    AND st.record_end_time IS NULL;
```

The join result looks similar to the following partial result:

![Query that returns the results of a join between a hybrid table and a standard table](/static/images/screens/hybrid_table_join_query.png)

## Step 8. Demonstrate security and governance

In this step, you will run two security-related examples to demonstrate that Snowflake
security and governance functionality applies equally to standard tables
and hybrid tables.

Roles and grants of privileges to those roles are standard mechanisms for enforcing security when large numbers
of database users have access to the same system, whether the workload is transactional, analytic, or hybrid.

### Step 8.1. Set up hybrid table access control and user management

[Role-based access control (RBAC)](/user-guide/security-access-control-overview)
works the same for hybrid tables and standard tables. You can manage access to hybrid table data in Snowflake by
granting privileges to some roles.

First, create a new `hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role` role. Use the ACCOUNTADMIN role to create the new role.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
CREATE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role;
SET my_user = CURRENT_USER();
GRANT ROLE hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role TO USER IDENTIFIER($my_user);
```

Now you can grant USAGE privileges for the `hybrid_quickstart_wh` warehouse, `hybrid_quickstart_db` database,
and all of its schemas to the new role. Use `hybrid_quickstart_role` to run the GRANT statements.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE hybrid_quickstart_wh TO ROLE hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE hybrid_quickstart_db TO ROLE hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE hybrid_quickstart_db TO hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role;
```

Using the new role (`hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role`), try to select some data from the `order_header` table.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role;
USE DATABASE hybrid_quickstart_db;
USE SCHEMA data;

SELECT * FROM order_header LIMIT 10;
```

You cannot select any data because the role `hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role` has not been granted the necessary
SELECT privilege on the tables. You receive the following error message:

```
Object 'ORDER_HEADER' does not exist or not authorized.
```

To solve this problem, use the role `hybrid_quickstart_role` to grant SELECT privileges on all the tables in the
`data` schema to `hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role`.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA DATA TO ROLE hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role;
```

Try again to select data from the `order_header` hybrid table.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role;
SELECT * FROM order_header LIMIT 10;
```

This time the query succeeds because HYBRID\_QUICKSTART\_BI\_USER\_ROLE has the appropriate privileges at all
levels of the hierarchy. The output looks similar to the following partial result:

![Query that now allows access to order_header after SELECT is granted on the DATA schema](/static/images/screens/query_succeeds_after_grant_select_on_schema.png)

### Step 8.2. Create and implement a masking policy

In this step, you create a [masking policy](/user-guide/security-column-intro) and apply it to the
`truck_email` column in the `truck` hybrid table by using an ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN statement.
A masking policy is a standard way of controlling the column-level visibility of data to users with different roles
and privileges.

Note

To create masking policies, you must use an Enterprise Edition account (or a higher-level account). If you are
using a Standard Edition account, skip this step. For more information, see [Snowflake editions](/user-guide/intro-editions).

Use the `hybrid_quickstart_role` role, then create the new masking policy, which is intended to mask entire column
values from unauthorized roles.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;

CREATE MASKING POLICY hide_column_values AS
  (col_value VARCHAR) RETURNS VARCHAR ->
    CASE WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('HYBRID_QUICKSTART_ROLE') THEN col_value
      ELSE '***MASKED***'
      END;
```

Now apply this policy to the hybrid table.

Copy code

```
ALTER TABLE truck MODIFY COLUMN truck_email
  SET MASKING POLICY hide_column_values USING (truck_email);
```

Because you are currently using the `hybrid_quickstart_role`, the `truck_email` column should *not* be masked.
Run the following query:

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM truck LIMIT 10;
```

![Query that does not mask the truck_email column](/static/images/screens/truck_email_column_not_masked.png)

Switch to `HYBRID_QUICKSTART_BI_USER_ROLE` and run the query again. The `TRUCK_EMAIL` column should be
masked now.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role;
SELECT * FROM truck LIMIT 10;
```

![Query that masks the truck_email column](/static/images/screens/truck_email_column_masked.png)

## Step 9. Cleanup, conclusion, and further reading

### Cleanup

To clean up your Snowflake environment, run the following SQL statements:

Copy code

```
USE ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;
USE WAREHOUSE hybrid_quickstart_wh;
USE DATABASE hybrid_quickstart_db;
USE SCHEMA data;
```

Copy code

```
DROP DATABASE hybrid_quickstart_db;
DROP WAREHOUSE hybrid_quickstart_wh;
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
DROP ROLE hybrid_quickstart_role;
DROP ROLE hybrid_quickstart_bi_user_role;
```

Finally, manually delete the `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart` and `Hybrid Tables - QuickStart Session 2`
worksheets.
