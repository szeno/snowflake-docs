# Tutorial: JSON basics for Snowflake

## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn the basics of using JSON with Snowflake.

### What you will learn

In this tutorial, you learn how to do the following:

- Upload sample JSON data from a public S3 bucket into a column of the `variant` type in a
  Snowflake table.
- Test simple queries for JSON data in the table.
- Explore the FLATTEN function to flatten JSON data into a relational representation and save it
  in another table.
- Explore ways to ensure uniqueness as you insert rows in the flattened version of the data.

## Prerequisites

The tutorial assumes the following:

- You have a Snowflake account that is configured to use Amazon AWS and a user with
  a role that grants the necessary privileges to create a database, tables, and
  virtual warehouse objects.
- You have [SnowSQL (CLI client)](/user-guide/snowsql) installed.

The [Snowflake in 20 minutes](/user-guide/tutorials/snowflake-in-20minutes) tutorial provides the related
step-by-step instructions to meet these requirements.

Snowflake provides sample data files in a public S3 bucket for use in this tutorial.
But before you start, you need to create a database, tables, a virtual warehouse,
and an external stage for this tutorial. These are the basic Snowflake objects
needed for most Snowflake activities.

### About the sample data file

For this tutorial, you use the following sample application events JSON data provided in a public S3 bucket.

Copy code

```
{
"device_type": "server",
"events": [
  {
    "f": 83,
    "rv": "15219.64,783.63,48674.48,84679.52,27499.78,2178.83,0.42,74900.19",
    "t": 1437560931139,
    "v": {
      "ACHZ": 42869,
      "ACV": 709489,
      "DCA": 232,
      "DCV": 62287,
      "ENJR": 2599,
      "ERRS": 205,

  },
  {
    "f": 1000083,
    "rv": "8070.52,54470.71,85331.27,9.10,70825.85,65191.82,46564.53,29422.22",
    "t": 1437036965027,
    "v": {
      "ACHZ": 6953,
      "ACV": 346795,
      "DCA": 250,
      "DCV": 46066,
      "ENJR": 9033,
      "ERRS": 615,
      "MXEC": 0,
      "TMPI": 112
    },
    "vd": 626,
    "z": 1437660796958
  }
],
"version": 2.6
}
```

The data represents sample events that applications upload to S3. A variety of devices and applications, such as servers, cell phones, and browsers publish events. In a common data
collection scenario, a scalable web endpoint collects POSTed data from different sources and writes them to a queuing
system. An ingest service/utility then writes the data to a S3
bucket, from which you can load the data into Snowflake.

The sample data illustrates the following concepts:

- Applications can choose to group events in batches. A batch is a container
  that holds header information common to all of the events in the batch. For example, the preceding JSON is a batch of two
  events with common header information: `device_type` and `version` that generated these events.
- Amazon S3 supports using folders concept to organize a bucket. Applications can leverage this feature to partition event data.
  Partitioning schemes typically identify details, such as application or location that generated the event, along with
  an event date when it was written to S3. Such a partitioning scheme enables you to copy any fraction of the partitioned
  data to Snowflake with a single COPY command. For example, you can copy event data by the hour, data, month, or year
  when you initially populate tables.

  For example:

  `s3://bucket_name/application_a/2016/07/01/11/`
  `s3://bucket_name/application_b/location_c/2016/07/01/14/`

  Note the `application_a`, `application_b`, `location_c`, etc. identify details for the source
  of all data in the path. The data can be organized by the date when it was written.
  An optional 24-hour directory reduces the amount of data in each directory.

  Note

  S3 transmits a directory list with each COPY statement used by Snowflake, so reducing
  the number of files in each directory improves the performance of your COPY statements.
  You may even consider creating 10-15 minute increment folders in each hour.

  The sample data provided in the S3 bucket uses a similar partitioning scheme. In a COPY command you
  will specify a specific folder path to copy events data.

### Creating the database, table, warehouse, and external stage

Execute the following statements to create a database, a table, a virtual warehouse,
and an external stage needed for this tutorial. After you complete the tutorial,
you can drop these objects.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE mydatabase;
>
> USE SCHEMA mydatabase.public;
>
> CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE raw_source (
>   SRC VARIANT);
>
> CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE mywarehouse WITH
>   WAREHOUSE_SIZE='X-SMALL'
>   AUTO_SUSPEND = 120
>   AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
>   INITIALLY_SUSPENDED=TRUE;
>
> USE WAREHOUSE mywarehouse;
>
> CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_stage
>   URL = 's3://snowflake-docs/tutorials/json';
> ```

Note the following:

- The `CREATE DATABASE` statement creates a database. The database automatically
  includes a schema named ‘public’.
- The `USE SCHEMA` statement specifies an active database and schema for the current user session.
  Specifying a database now enables you to perform your work in this database without having
  to provide the name each time it is requested.
- The `CREATE TABLE` statement creates a target table for JSON data.
- The `CREATE WAREHOUSE` statement creates an initially suspended warehouse. The
  statement also sets AUTO\_RESUME = true, which starts the warehouse automatically
  when you execute SQL statements that require compute resources.
  The `USE WAREHOUSE` statement specifies the warehouse you created as the active
  warehouse for the current user session.
- The `CREATE STAGE` statement creates an external stage that points to the S3 bucket
  containing the sample file for this tutorial.

## Copy data into the target table

Execute [COPY INTO <table>](/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table) to load your staged data into
the target `RAW_SOURCE` table.

Copy code

```
COPY INTO raw_source
  FROM @my_stage/server/2.6/2016/07/15/15
  FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = JSON);
```

The command copies all new data from the specified path on the external stage
to the target `RAW_SOURCE` table. In this example, the specified path targets data
written on the 15th hour (3 PM) of July 15th, 2016.
Note that Snowflake checks each file’s S3 ETag value to ensure it is
copied only once.

Execute a SELECT query to verify the data is copied successfully.

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM raw_source;
```

The query returns the following result:

|     }                                                                             |
|   ],                                                                              |
|   "version": 2.6                                                                  |
| }                                                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

In this sample JSON data, there are two events. The `device_type`,
and `version` key values identify a data source and version for
events from a specific device.

## Query data

In this section, you explore SELECT statements to query the JSON data.

1. Retrieve `device_type`.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT src:device_type
     FROM raw_source;
   ```

   The query return the following result:

   Copy code

   ```
   +-----------------+
   | SRC:DEVICE_TYPE |
   |-----------------|
   | "server"        |
   +-----------------+
   ```

   The query uses the `src:device_type` notation
   to specify the column name and the JSON element name to retrieve. This
   notation is similar to the
   familiar SQL `table.column` notation.
   Snowflake allows you to specify a
   sub-column within a parent column, which Snowflake dynamically derives from the
   schema definition embedded in the JSON data. For more information,
   refer to [Querying Semi-structured Data](/user-guide/querying-semistructured).

   > Note
   >
   > The column name is case-insensitive, however JSON element names
   > are case-sensitive.
2. Retrieve the `device_type` value without the quotes.

   The preceding query returns the JSON data value in quote. You can remove
   the quotes by casting the data to a specific data type,
   in this example a string.

   This query also optionally assigns a name to the column using an alias.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT src:device_type::string AS device_type
     FROM raw_source;
   ```

   The query returns the following result:

   Copy code

   ```
   +-------------+
   | DEVICE_TYPE |
   |-------------|
   | server      |
   +-------------+
   ```
3. Retrieve repeating `f` keys nested within the array event objects.

   The sample JSON data includes `events` array. Each event object in the array
   has the `f` field as shown.

   Copy code

   ```
   {
   "device_type": "server",
   "events": [
     {
    "f": 83,
    ..
     }
     {
    "f": 1000083,
    ..
     }
   ]}
   ```

   To retrieve these nested keys, you can use the [FLATTEN](/sql-reference/functions/flatten)
   function. The function flattens the events into separate rows.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT
     value:f::number
     FROM
    raw_source
     , LATERAL FLATTEN( INPUT => SRC:events );
   ```

   The query returns the following result:

   Copy code

   ```
   +-----------------+
   | VALUE:F::NUMBER |
   |-----------------|
   |              83 |
   |         1000083 |
   +-----------------+
   ```

   Note the `value` is one of the columns that FLATTEN function returns.
   The next step provides more details about using the FLATTEN function.

## Flatten data

[FLATTEN](/sql-reference/functions/flatten) is a table function that produces a lateral
view of a VARIANT, OBJECT, or ARRAY column. In this step, you use this function
to explore different levels of flattening.

### Flatten array objects in a variant column

You can flatten the event objects in the `events` array into separate rows
using the `FLATTEN` function. The function output includes a
VALUE column that stores these individual events.

You can then use the LATERAL modifier to join the `FLATTEN` function output
with any information outside of the object — in this example,
the `device_type` and `version`.

1. Query the data for each event:

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT src:device_type::string,
    src:version::String,
    VALUE
   FROM
    raw_source,
    LATERAL FLATTEN( INPUT => SRC:events );
   ```

   The query returns the following result:

   ```
   +-------------------------+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | SRC:DEVICE_TYPE::STRING | SRC:VERSION::STRING | VALUE                                                                         |
   |-------------------------+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

2. Use a CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statement to store the preceding query result in a table:

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE flattened_source AS
     SELECT
    src:device_type::string AS device_type,
    src:version::string     AS version,
    VALUE                   AS src
     FROM
    raw_source,
    LATERAL FLATTEN( INPUT => SRC:events );
   ```

   Query the resulting table.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT * FROM flattened_source;
   ```

   The query returns the following result:

   ```

### Flatten object keys in separate columns

In the preceding example, you flattened the event objects in the `events` array
into separate rows. The resulting `flattened_source` table retained the event structure
in the `src` column of the VARIANT type.

One benefit of retaining the
event objects in the `src` column of the VARIANT type is that when event format changes,
you don’t have to recreate and repopulate such tables. But you also have the option to
copy individual keys in the event object into separate typed columns as shown
in the following query.

The following CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statement creates a new table named `events` with the event
object keys stored in separate columns. Each value is cast to a data type that is appropriate
for the value, using a double-colon (::) followed by the type. If you omit the casting,
the column assumes the VARIANT data type, which can hold any value:

Copy code

```
create or replace table events as
  select
    src:device_type::string                             as device_type
  , src:version::string                                 as version

```

The statement flattens the nested data in the EVENTS.SRC:V key, adding a separate column for each value.
The statement outputs a row for each key/value pair. The following output shows the first two records in the new `events` table:

## Update data

So far in this tutorial, you did the following:

- Copied sample JSON event data from an S3 bucket into the `RAW_SOURCE` table
  and explored simple queries.
- You also explored the FLATTEN function to flatten the JSON data and obtain a relational
  representation of the data. For example, you extracted event keys and stored the keys
  in separate columns in another EVENTS table.

At the beginning, the tutorial explains the application scenario where multiple sources generate
events and a web endpoint saves it to your S3 bucket. As new events are added to the S3 bucket,
you might use a script to continuously copy new data into the `RAW_SOURCE` table.
But how do insert only new event data into the `EVENTS` table.

There are numerous ways to maintain data consistency. This section explains two options.

### Use primary key columns for comparison

In this section you add a primary key to the `EVENTS` table. The primary key then guarantees uniqueness.

1. Examine your JSON data for any values that are naturally unique and would be good
   candidates for a primary key. For example, assume that the combination of
   `src:device_type` and `value:rv` can be a primary key. These two JSON keys
   correspond to the `DEVICE_TYPE` and `RV` columns in the `EVENTS` table.

   Note

   Snowflake does not enforce the primary key constraint. Rather, the constraint
   serves as metadata that identifies the natural key in the Information Schema.
2. Add the primary key constraint to the `EVENTS` table:

   Copy code

   ```
   ALTER TABLE events ADD CONSTRAINT pk_DeviceType PRIMARY KEY (device_type, rv);
   ```
3. Insert a new JSON event record into the `RAW_SOURCE` table:

   Copy code

   ```
   insert into raw_source
     select
     PARSE_JSON ('{
    "device_type": "cell_phone",
    "events": [
      {
        "f": 79,
        "rv": "786954.67,492.68,3577.48,40.11,343.00,345.8,0.22,8765.22",
        "t": 5769784730576,
        "v": {
          "ACHZ": 75846,
          "ACV": 098355,
          "DCA": 789,
          "DCV": 62287,
          "ENJR": 2234,
          "ERRS": 578,
          "MXEC": 999,
          "TMPI": 9
        },
        "vd": 54,
        "z": 1437644222811
      }
    ],
    "version": 3.2
     }');
   ```
4. Insert the new record that you added to the `RAW_SOURCE` table
   into the `EVENTS` table based on a comparison of the primary key values:

   Copy code

   ```
   insert into events
   select
      src:device_type::string
    , src:version::string
    , value:f::number
    , value:rv::variant
    , value:t::number
    , value:v.ACHZ::number
    , value:v.ACV::number
    , value:v.DCA::number
    , value:v.DCV::number
    , value:v.ENJR::number
    , value:v.ERRS::number
    , value:v.MXEC::number
    , value:v.TMPI::number
    , value:vd::number
    , value:z::number
    from
      raw_source
    , lateral flatten( input => src:events )
    where not exists
    (select 'x'
      from events
      where events.device_type = src:device_type
      and events.rv = value:rv);
   ```

   Querying the `EVENTS` table shows the added row:

   Copy code

   ```
   select * from EVENTS;
   ```

   The query returns the following result:

   ```

### Use all columns for comparison

If the JSON data does not have fields that can be primary key candidates, you
could compare all repeating JSON keys in the `RAW_SOURCE` table with the
corresponding column values in the `EVENTS` table.

No changes to your existing `EVENTS` table are required.

1. Insert a new JSON event record into the `RAW_SOURCE` table:

   Copy code

   ```
   insert into raw_source
     select
     parse_json ('{
    "device_type": "web_browser",
    "events": [
      {
        "f": 79,
        "rv": "122375.99,744.89,386.99,12.45,78.08,43.7,9.22,8765.43",
        "t": 5769784730576,
        "v": {
          "ACHZ": 768436,
          "ACV": 9475,
          "DCA": 94835,
          "DCV": 88845,
          "ENJR": 8754,
          "ERRS": 567,
          "MXEC": 823,
          "TMPI": 0
        },
        "vd": 55,
        "z": 8745598047355
      }
    ],
    "version": 8.7
     }');
   ```
2. Insert the new record in the `RAW_SOURCE` table into the `EVENTS` table based on a comparison of all repeating key values:

   Copy code

   ```
   insert into events
   select
      src:device_type::string
    , src:version::string
    , value:f::number
    , value:rv::variant
    , value:t::number
    , value:v.ACHZ::number
    , value:v.ACV::number
    , value:v.DCA::number
    , value:v.DCV::number
    , value:v.ENJR::number
    , value:v.ERRS::number
    , value:v.MXEC::number
    , value:v.TMPI::number
    , value:vd::number
    , value:z::number
    from
      raw_source
    , lateral flatten( input => src:events )
    where not exists
    (select 'x'
      from events
      where events.device_type = src:device_type
      and events.version = src:version
      and events.f = value:f
      and events.rv = value:rv
      and events.t = value:t
      and events.achz = value:v.ACHZ
      and events.acv = value:v.ACV
      and events.dca = value:v.DCA
      and events.dcv = value:v.DCV
      and events.enjr = value:v.ENJR
      and events.errs = value:v.ERRS
      and events.mxec = value:v.MXEC
      and events.tmpi = value:v.TMPI
      and events.vd = value:vd
      and events.z = value:z);
   ```

   Querying the `EVENTS` table shows the added row:

   Copy code

   ```
   select * from EVENTS;
   ```

   The query returns the following result:

## Congratulations

Congratulations, you have successfully completed the tutorial.

### Tutorial key points

- Partitioning the event data in your S3 bucket using logical, granular paths allows you to copy a subset of the partitioned data into Snowflake with a single command.
- Snowflake’s `column:key` notation, similar to the familiar SQL `table.column` notation,
  allows you to effectively query a column within the column (i.e., a sub-column), which is
  dynamically derived based on the schema definition embedded in the JSON data.
- The [FLATTEN](/sql-reference/functions/flatten) function allows you to parse JSON data into separate columns.
- Several options are available to update table data based on comparisons with staged data files.

### Tutorial clean up (optional)

Execute the following [DROP <object>](/sql-reference/sql/drop) commands to return your system to its state before you began the tutorial:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS mydatabase;
> DROP WAREHOUSE IF EXISTS mywarehouse;
> ```

Dropping the database automatically removes all child database objects such as tables.
