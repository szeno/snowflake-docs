# Downloading Snowflake Clients, Connectors, Drivers, and Libraries

To download the installation package for a Snowflake client, connector, driver, or library, use the
[download pages in the Snowflake Developer Center](#label-client-download-developer-center).

If you want to write a script to download clients over HTTP (e.g. using [curl](https://curl.se/)), you can download SnowSQL, the ODBC Driver,
the Snowpark Library, and SnowCD directly from the [Snowflake Client Repository](#label-client-download-repository).

See [Drivers](/developer-guide/drivers) and [Using Snowflake with Kafka and Spark](/user-guide/connectors) for documentation for the drivers and
connectors, respectively. For other developer documentation,
see [Develop Apps and Extensions](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer).

## Snowflake Developer Center Download Pages

To download a Snowflake client, use the following download pages in the [Snowflake Developer Center](https://developers.snowflake.com/):

## Snowflake Client Repository

To download SnowSQL, the ODBC Driver, the Snowpark Library, or SnowCD over HTTP programmatically (e.g. using [curl](https://curl.se/)), use the
Snowflake Client Repository. The Snowflake Client Repository serves the packages for these clients through CDN (Content Delivery
Network) using the following endpoints:

> - <https://sfc-repo.azure.snowflakecomputing.com/index.html> (mirror on Azure Blob)

If the endpoint is not specified explicitly, the client upgrader (e.g., the SnowSQL auto-upgrader) uses the AWS endpoint. For instructions on specifying the endpoint, see the installation documentation for the client.

Note

Users can download Snowflake clients from either endpoint regardless of which cloud provider hosts their Snowflake account.
