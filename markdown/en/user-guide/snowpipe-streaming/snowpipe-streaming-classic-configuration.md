# Configurations and examples for Snowpipe Streaming classic architecture

## Snowpipe Streaming properties: Classic architecture

Configure the API connection settings in a `profile.json` file. The properties are described in this topic.

As shown in the [Java example](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-ingest-java/blob/master/src/main/java/net/snowflake/ingest/streaming/example/SnowflakeStreamingIngestExample.java) (GitHub), you can load the settings from `profile.json` by specifying the file path as the input to the variable `PROFILE_PATH`.

### Required properties

`authorization_type`
:   Configure the authentication and authorization method for the user. You can use one of the following methods:

    - `JWT` : key pair authentication with JSON Web Token (JWT). This is the default method. If `authorization_type` is not configured, the default method `JWT` is used. Configure the following `private_key` for key pair authentication:

      - `private_key`
        Private key to authenticate the user. Include only the key, not the header or footer. If the key is split across multiple lines, remove the line breaks.

        You can provide an unencrypted key, or you can provide an encrypted key and provide the `snowflake.private.key.passphrase` parameter to enable Snowflake to decrypt the key. Use this parameter *if and only if* the `snowflake.private.key` parameter value is encrypted.
    - `OAuth` : Snowflake OAuth. This option is only available with the Java Snowflake Ingest SDK (versions 2.0.3 and later). Configure the following parameters for Snowflake OAuth in the `profile.json` file:

      - `oauth_client_id` : The client ID of the OAuth integration.
      - `oauth_client_secret` : The client secret of the OAuth integration.
      - `oauth_refresh_token` : A valid refresh token of the OAuth integration.

      To support token refresh on Snowflake/OKTA OAuth, you must configure three parameters: `oauth_client_id`, `oauth_client_secret`, and `oauth_refresh_token`. However, if you use a customized API endpoint for OAuth that doesn’t require these values in the token refresh request, you can fill in the fields for these parameters with any placeholders.

`url`
:   URL for accessing your Snowflake account. This URL must include your [account identifier](/user-guide/admin-account-identifier). The protocol (`https://`) and port number are optional.

    `url` is not required if you are already using the Snowflake Ingest SDK and have set the `host`, `scheme`, and `port` properties in the `profile.json` file.

`user`
:   User login name for the Snowflake account.

### Optional properties

`enable_iceberg_streaming`
:   Set the property to `true` to enable Snowpipe Streaming with the Snowflake-managed Apache Iceberg™ table. For more information, see [Snowpipe Streaming Classic with Apache Iceberg™ tables](/user-guide/snowpipe-streaming/snowpipe-streaming-classic-iceberg).

`max_client_lag`
:   Use this property to configure the data flush latency. By default, Snowpipe Streaming flushes data every 1 second for standard Snowflake tables (non-Apache Iceberg). The max\_client\_lag configuration lets you override that and set it to your desired flush latency from 1 second to 10 minutes. For more information, see [Snowpipe Streaming latency recommendations](/user-guide/snowpipe-streaming/snowpipe-streaming-classic-recommendation#label-snowpipe-streaming-recommendations-latency).

`snowflake.private.key.passphrase`
:   Passphrase to decrypt the private key when the key is encrypted. For information, see [Using key pair authentication and key rotation](#using-key-pair-authentication-and-key-rotation) (in this topic).

`role`
:   Access control role to use for the session after connecting to Snowflake.

    The `role` property is optional for Snowflake Ingest SDK versions 2.0.3 and later. It is required for earlier Ingest SDK versions.

## Authentication and authorization

### Using Snowflake OAuth

With the Java Snowflake Ingest SDK (versions 2.0.3 and later) or Snowflake Connector for Kafka (versions 2.1.2 and later), you can use Snowflake OAuth as an authorization method.

Follow [the workflow](/user-guide/oauth-custom) to create a Snowflake OAuth integration and to call OAuth endpoints to request authorization codes and refresh access tokens. The response of token requests contains `oauth_refresh_token`. After a Snowflake OAuth integration is created, run the [SYSTEM$SHOW\_OAUTH\_CLIENT\_SECRETS](/sql-reference/functions/system_show_oauth_client_secrets) function to obtain `oauth_client_id` and `oauth_client_secret`.

To enable Snowflake OAuth, in the `profile.json` file, set `authorization_type` as `OAuth`, and complete the fields `oauth_refresh_token`, `oauth_client_id`, and `oauth_client_secret` with the parameters obtained above.

### Using key pair authentication and key rotation

API calls rely on key pair authentication with JSON Web Token (JWT). JWTs are signed using a public/private key pair with RSA encryption.
This authentication method requires a 2048-bit (minimum) RSA key pair. Generate the public-private key pair using OpenSSL. The public key
is assigned to the Snowflake user defined in the properties file.

Complete the key pair authentication instructions described in [key pair rotation](/user-guide/key-pair-auth). Copy and paste the
entire private key into the `snowflake.private.key` field in the properties file. Save the file.

See [Java Example](/developer-guide/sql-api/authenticating#label-sql-api-authenticating-key-pair-java) for an example of creating a fingerprint and generating a JWT token.

Next, evaluate the recommendation for [Externalizing secrets](#externalizing-secrets) (in this topic).

### Externalizing secrets

Snowflake strongly recommends externalizing secrets such as the private key and storing them in an encrypted form or in a key management service such as AWS Key Management Service (KMS), Microsoft Azure Key Vault,
or HashiCorp Vault.

For more information, see the Confluent description of this [service](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/security.html#externalizing-secrets).
