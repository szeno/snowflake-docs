# Explore and manage database objects in Snowsight

You can explore and manage your database objects in Snowsight using the *database object explorer*. The database object
explorer contains a hierarchical view of all databases in your account, the schemas for each database, and the objects contained
in each database and schema, organized by type.

![Snowsight database object explorer, rendered as a tree view, with expandable objects such as schemas, tables, views, stages, and more.](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-data-database-object-explorer.png)

To open the database object explorer:

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Catalog** » **Database Explorer**.
3. Explore your database objects in the database object explorer.

You can only see objects on which your active role has been granted, at a minimum, the USAGE privilege.
For more information about object privileges, see [Access control privileges](/user-guide/security-access-control-privileges).

You can also explore database objects from the context of a worksheet. See [Refer to database object names in worksheets](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-query#label-worksheets-db-objects).

## Working with databases in Snowsight

When you select a database in the database object explorer, you can view details about the database.

You must have the relevant [database privileges](/user-guide/security-access-control-privileges#label-database-privileges) to access and manage the database in Snowsight.

After opening a database in Snowsight, you can do the following:

- Identify whether the database is a shared database.
- Review the source of the database, such as local, share, Snowflake Marketplace, a data exchange, or privately shared by a provider.
- Determine the owner role for the database.
- Identify when the database was created. You can hover over the time details to see the exact creation date and time.

### Manage a shared database in Snowsight

For a shared database, you can review the **Source details** to learn more about the sharing source:

- For a direct share, you can see the name of the share from which the database was created, and the provider account name.
- For a listing published on the Snowflake Marketplace or in a data exchange, you can see the name of the provider and the listing from which
  the database was created. Select the provider name to open the provider profile, or listing name to open the listing details on
  the Snowflake Marketplace or in the data exchange.
- For a private listing, you can see the name of the provider and the listing from which the database was created. To open the listing
  details, in the navigation menu, select **Data sharing** » **Internal sharing** » **Shared with You**, and then select the listing name.

You can perform the following basic management tasks for a shared database in Snowsight:

- To edit the database name or add a comment, select [![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheet-explorer-ellipsis.png)](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheet-explorer-ellipsis.png) » **Edit**.
- To drop the database, select [![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheet-explorer-ellipsis.png)](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheet-explorer-ellipsis.png) » **Drop**. This removes the database created from the share or listing.
- Review and manage privileges in the **Privileges** section of the **Database Details** tab.
  To manage privileges, see [Manage object privileges with Snowsight](/user-guide/security-access-control-configure#label-snowsight-manage-object-privileges).
