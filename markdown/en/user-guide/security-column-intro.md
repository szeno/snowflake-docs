# Understanding Column-level Security

[Enterprise Edition Feature](/user-guide/intro-editions)

This feature requires Enterprise Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).

This topic provides a general overview of Column-level Security and describes the features and support that are common to both Dynamic Data
Masking and External Tokenization.

To learn more about using a masking policy with a tag, see [Tag-based masking policies](/user-guide/tag-based-masking-policies).

## What is Column-level Security?

Column-level Security in Snowflake allows the application of a masking policy to a column within a table or view. Currently, Column-level Security includes two features:

1. [Dynamic Data Masking](/user-guide/security-column-ddm-intro)
2. [External Tokenization](/user-guide/security-column-ext-token-intro)

Dynamic Data Masking is a Column-level Security feature that uses masking policies to selectively mask plain-text data in table and view columns at query time.

External Tokenization enables accounts to tokenize data before loading it into Snowflake and detokenize the data at query runtime. Tokenization is the process of removing sensitive data by replacing it with an undecipherable token. External Tokenization makes use of masking policies with [external functions](/sql-reference/external-functions).

### What are masking policies?

Snowflake supports masking policies as a schema-level object to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access while allowing authorized users to access sensitive data at query runtime. This means that sensitive data in Snowflake is not modified in an existing table (i.e. no static masking). Rather, when users execute a query in which a masking policy applies, the masking policy conditions determine whether unauthorized users see masked, partially masked, obfuscated, or tokenized data. Masking policies as a schema-level object also provide flexibility in choosing a centralized, decentralized, or hybrid management approach. For more information, see [Managing Column-level Security](#managing-column-level-security) (in this topic).

Masking policies can include conditions and functions to transform the data at query runtime when those conditions are met. The policy-driven approach supports segregation of duties to allow security teams to define policies that can limit sensitive data exposure, even to the owner of an object (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the object, such as a table or view) who normally has full access to the underlying data.

> ![The masking policy admin can apply masking policies to tables and views.](/static/images/security-column-intro-admin-apply-policies.png)

For example, masking policy administrators can implement a masking policy such that analysts (i.e. users with the custom ANALYST role) can only view the last four digits of a phone number and none of the social security number, while customer support representatives (i.e. users with the custom SUPPORT role) can view the entire phone number and social security number for customer verification use cases.

> ![Masking policy results for authorized and unauthorized roles.](/static/images/security-column-intro-authz-phone-ssn.png)

A masking policy consists of a single [data type](/sql-reference-data-types), one or more conditions, and one or more masking
functions.

- You can apply the masking policy to one or more table/view columns with the matching data type. For example, you can define a policy for an email address once and apply it to 1000s of email columns across databases and schemas.
- Masking policy conditions can be expressed using [Conditional expression functions](/sql-reference/expressions-conditional) and [Context functions](/sql-reference/functions-context) or by querying a custom entitlement table. You can use the context functions [INVOKER\_ROLE](/sql-reference/functions/invoker_role) and [INVOKER\_SHARE](/sql-reference/functions/invoker_share) for use with views and shares, respectively.
- Masking functions can be any of the built-in functions (e.g. [REGEXP\_REPLACE](/sql-reference/functions/regexp_replace), [SHA2 , SHA2\_HEX](/sql-reference/functions/sha2)), [User-defined functions overview](/developer-guide/udf/udf-overview), or [Writing external functions](/sql-reference/external-functions) (for de-tokenization using an external tokenization provider).

While Snowflake offers [secure views](/user-guide/views-secure) to restrict access to sensitive data, secure views present management challenges due to large numbers of views and derived business intelligence (BI) dashboards from each view. Masking policies solve this management challenge by avoiding an explosion of views and dashboards to manage.

Masking policies support segregation of duties (SoD) through the role separation of policy administrators from object owners. Secure views do not have SoD, which is a profound limitation to their utility. This role separation leads to the following default settings:

- Object owners (i.e. the role that has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the object) do not have the privilege to unset masking policies.
- Object owners cannot view column data in which a masking policy applies.

For more information on managing roles and privileges, see [Managing Column-level Security](#managing-column-level-security) (in this topic) and [Access control privileges](/user-guide/security-access-control-privileges).

Note

In some cases, error messages related to masking policies might be redacted. For more information, see
[Secure objects: Redaction of information in error messages](/release-notes/bcr-bundles/un-bundled/bcr-1858).

#### How does a masking policy work?

Masking policies for Dynamic Data Masking and External Tokenization adopt the same structure and format with one notable exception: masking policies for External Tokenization require using [Writing external functions](/sql-reference/external-functions) in the masking policy body.

The reason for this exception is that External Tokenization requires a third-party tokenization provider to tokenize data before loading data into Snowflake. At query runtime, Snowflake uses the external function to make a REST API call to the tokenization provider, which then evaluates a tokenization policy (that is created outside of Snowflake) to return either tokenized or detokenized data based on the masking policy conditions. Note that role mapping must exist in Snowflake and the tokenization provider to ensure that the correct data can be returned from a given query.

Snowflake supports creating masking policies using [CREATE MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy). For example:

Copy code

```
-- Dynamic Data Masking

CREATE MASKING POLICY employee_ssn_mask AS (val string) RETURNS string ->
  CASE
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('PAYROLL') THEN val
    ELSE '******'
  END;

-- External Tokenization

  CREATE MASKING POLICY employee_ssn_detokenize AS (val string) RETURNS string ->
  CASE
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('PAYROLL') THEN ssn_unprotect(VAL)
    ELSE val -- sees tokenized data
  END;
```

Where:

> `employee_ssn_mask`
> :   The name of the Dynamic Data Masking policy.
>
> `employee_ssn_detokenize`
> :   The name of the External Tokenization policy.
>
> `AS (val string) RETURNS string`
> :   Specifies the input and output data types. The data types must match.
>
> `->`
> :   Separates the policy signature from its body.
>
> `case ... end;`
> :   Specifies the masking policy body (i.e. SQL expression) conditions.
>
>     In these two examples, if the query operator is using the PAYROLL custom role in the current session, the operator sees the unmasked/detokenized value. Otherwise, a fixed masked/tokenized value is seen.
>
> `ssn_unprotect`
> :   The external function to operate on the tokenized data.

Tip

If you want to update an existing masking policy and need to see the current definition of the policy, call the [GET\_DDL](/sql-reference/functions/get_ddl) function or run the [DESCRIBE MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/desc-masking-policy) command.

The masking policy definition can then be updated with the [ALTER MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/alter-masking-policy) command. This command does not
require unsetting a masking policy from a column, if the masking policy is set on a column. So, a column that is protected by a policy
remains protected while the policy definition is being updated.

For more details on using masking policies, see:

- [Using Column-level Security on Tables and Views](#using-column-level-security-on-tables-and-views) (in this topic)
- [Dynamic Data Masking](/user-guide/security-column-ddm-intro)
- [External Tokenization](/user-guide/security-column-ext-token-intro)
- [Advanced Column-level Security topics](/user-guide/security-column-advanced)
- [IS\_ROLE\_IN\_SESSION](/sql-reference/functions/is_role_in_session) (for policy examples when role hierarchy and role activation is important)

#### Mask column values when an agent is active

When an agent is active in the execution context, you can use [IS\_AGENT\_ACTIVATED](/sql-reference/functions/is_agent_activated) in a
masking policy to mask column values even when the user’s role would otherwise allow viewing unmasked data. When no agent is active, only
the `ANALYST` custom role can view the raw value:

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE MASKING POLICY email_agent_mask AS (val STRING) RETURNS STRING ->
  CASE
    WHEN SYS_CONTEXT('SNOWFLAKE$CURRENT', 'IS_AGENT_ACTIVATED')::BOOLEAN = TRUE THEN '********'
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('ANALYST') THEN val
    ELSE '********'
  END;
```

For more about using agent identity in data protection policies, see
[Data protection policies for agentic interactions](/user-guide/data-protection-policies-snowsight#label-data-protection-policies-agentic).

#### Use conditional columns

Conditional masking uses a masking policy to selectively protect the column data in a table or view based on the values in one or more
different columns.

Using a different column to determine whether data in a given column should be protected offers policy administrators
(i.e. users with the `POLICY_ADMIN` custom role) more freedom to create policy conditions.

Note the difference between the two representative policy examples:

Masking policy:
:   This policy can be used for dynamic data masking.

    Copy code

    ```
    CREATE MASKING POLICY email_mask AS
    (val string) RETURNS string ->
      CASE
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('PAYROLL') THEN val
        ELSE '******'
      END;
    ```

    This policy specifies only one argument, `val`, which represents any column that contains string data. This policy can be created
    once and applied to any column containing string data. Only users whose [CURRENT\_ROLE](/sql-reference/functions/current_role) is the `PAYROLL`
    custom role can see the column data. Otherwise, Snowflake returns a fixed masked value in the query result.

    For more information, see [CREATE MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy).

Conditional masking policy:
:   Note the arguments, `(email varchar, visibility string)`, in this example.

    Copy code

    ```
    CREATE MASKING POLICY email_visibility AS
    (email varchar, visibility string) RETURNS varchar ->
      CASE
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'ADMIN' THEN email
        WHEN VISIBILITY = 'PUBLIC' THEN email
        ELSE '***MASKED***'
      END;
    ```

    This policy specifies two arguments, `email` and `visibility`, and these arguments are column names. The first column always
    specifies the column to mask. The second column is a conditional column to evaluate whether the first column should be masked. Multiple
    conditional columns can be specified. In this policy, users whose CURRENT\_ROLE is the `ADMIN` custom role can view the email address.
    If the email address also has a visibility column value of `Public`, then the email address is visible in the query result.
    Otherwise, Snowflake returns a query result with a fixed masked value for the email column.

    This policy can be used on multiple tables and views provided that column structure in the table or view matches the columns specified in
    the policy. For more information, see [CREATE MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy).

Since the same object type is used for each representative example, the overall behavior of the policies should be similar, including, but not limited to:

- Query runtime evaluation.
- Utility (e.g. protecting sensitive data, using [Context functions](/sql-reference/functions-context)).
- Privilege structure.
- Usage with different management approaches to support segregation of duties (SoD).

Limitations:
:   In addition to the existing [masking policy limitations](#label-security-column-limitations), conditional masking policies have
    the following limitations:

    - Row access policies. For details, see [Row Access Policies](#row-access-policies) (in this topic).
    - External tables. For details, see: [External tables](#label-security-column-intro-ext-table) (in this topic).

Considerations:
:   In addition to the existing normal [masking policy considerations](#label-security-column-considerations), evaluate the following
    points prior to using conditional masking policies:

    - Ensure all columns specified in the CREATE MASKING POLICY statement reside in the same table or view.
    - Minimize the number of column arguments in the policy definition. Snowflake must evaluate each column at query runtime. Specifying
      fewer columns leads to faster performance overall.
    - Track conditional column usage in a masking policy by calling the Information Schema table function
      [POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/functions/policy_references).

For more details on setting masking policies with conditional columns, see
[Apply a conditional masking policy on a column](#label-security-column-intro-apply-cond-cols) (in this topic).

#### Masking policies at query runtime

At runtime, Snowflake rewrites the query to apply the masking policy expression to the columns specified in the masking policy. The masking
policy is applied to the column regardless of where in a SQL expression the column is referenced, including:

- Projections.
- JOIN predicates.
- WHERE clause predicates.
- ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses.

Important

A masking policy is deliberately applied wherever the relevant column is referenced by a SQL construct to prevent the de-anonymization of
data through creative queries to include masked column data.

Therefore, if executing a query results in masked data in one or more columns, the query output may not provide the anticipated value
because the masked data prevents evaluating all of the query output data in the desired context.

**Masking policies with nested objects:**

> Snowflake supports nested masking policies, such as a masking policy on a table and a masking policy on a view for the same table. At
> query runtime, Snowflake evaluates all masking policies that are relevant to a given query in the following sequence:
>
> 1. The masking policy that is applicable to the table is always executed first.
> 2. The policy for the view is executed after evaluating the policy for the table.
> 3. If nested views exist (e.g. `table_1` » `view_1` » `view_2` » … `view_n`), the policies are applied in sequential
>    order from left to right.
>
> This pattern continues for however many masking policies exist with respect to the data in the query. The following diagram illustrates
> the relationship between a query performer, tables, views, and policies.
>
> ![Masking policies with tables and views.](/static/images/security-column-row-intro-policy-table-view.png)

**User queries:**

> The following example shows a user-submitted query followed by the Snowflake runtime query rewrite in which the masking policy
> (i.e. `sql_expression`) applies to the **email** column only.
>
> Copy code
>
> ```
> SELECT email, city
> FROM customers
> WHERE city = 'San Mateo';
>
> SELECT <SQL_expression>(email), city
> FROM customers
> WHERE city = 'San Mateo';
> ```

**Query with a protected column in the WHERE clause predicate (anti-pattern):**

> The following examples show a user-submitted query followed by the Snowflake runtime query rewrite in which the masking policy
> (i.e. `sql_expression`) applies to only one side of a comparison (e.g. the email column but not the string to which the email column
> is compared). The results of the query are not what the user intended. Masking only one side of a comparison is a common
> anti-pattern.
>
> Copy code
>
> ```
> SELECT email
> FROM customers
> WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
>
> SELECT <SQL_expression>(email)
> FROM customers
> WHERE <SQL_expression>(email) = 'user@example.com';
> ```

**Query with a protected column in the JOIN predicate (anti-pattern):**

> Copy code
>
> ```
> SELECT b.email, d.city
> FROM
>   sf_tuts.public.emp_basic AS b
>   JOIN sf_tuts.public.emp_details AS d ON b.email = d.email;
>
> SELECT
>   <SQL_expression>(b.email),
>   d.city
> FROM
>   sf_tuts.public.emp_basic AS b
>   JOIN sf_tuts.public.emp_details AS d ON <SQL_expression>(b.email) = <SQL_expression>(d.email);
> ```

#### Query runtime considerations

Snowflake recommends considering the following factors when trying to predict the effect of applying a masking policy to a column and whether the query operator sees masked data:

The current session:
:   Masking policy conditions using [CURRENT\_ROLE](/sql-reference/functions/current_role).

The executing role:
:   Masking policy conditions using [INVOKER\_ROLE](/sql-reference/functions/invoker_role).

Role hierarchy:
:   Masking policy conditions using [IS\_ROLE\_IN\_SESSION](/sql-reference/functions/is_role_in_session) or [IS\_GRANTED\_TO\_INVOKER\_ROLE](/sql-reference/functions/is_granted_to_invoker_role).

Data sharing:
:   Whether the data is shared using [Secure Data Sharing](/user-guide/data-sharing-gs). For details, see
    [Data Sharing](#label-security-column-intro-data-sharing) (in this topic).

Replication:
:   See [Replication](#label-security-column-replication) (in this topic).

Subqueries:
:   A masking policy can reference a subquery in the policy definition, however, there are limits to subquery support in Snowflake. For more information, see [Working with Subqueries](/user-guide/querying-subqueries).

UDFs in a masking policy:
:   Ensure the data type of the column, UDF, and masking policy match. For more information, see
    [User-defined functions in a masking policy](#label-security-column-intro-udf-policy) (in this topic).

Search optimization service:
:   The search optimization service can improve the query performance on a table that uses a masking or row access policy.

    For details, see
    [Support for Tables With Masking Policies and Row Access Policies in the Search Optimization Service](/user-guide/search-optimization/working-with-tables#label-search-optimization-service-masking-row-access).

The first three items are explained in greater detail in [Advanced Column-level Security topics](/user-guide/security-column-advanced). Data sharing only applies to Dynamic Data Masking because external functions cannot be invoked in the context of a share.

Ultimately, the specific use case determines whether Dynamic Data Masking or External Tokenization is the best fit.

## Choosing Dynamic Data Masking or External Tokenization

To choose the correct feature that best meets the need of your organization, evaluate the major use cases for your data along with relevant considerations and limitations. The following two sections summarize the benefits and limitations between the two features.

### Benefits

The following table compares the benefits of Dynamic Data Masking and External Tokenization.

| Factor | Dynamic Data Masking | External Tokenization | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preserve analytical value after de-identification. |  | ✔ | Since tokenization provides a unique value for a given set of characters, it is possible to group records by a tokenized value without revealing the sensitive information.  For example, group medical records by diagnosis code with the patient diagnosis code tokenized. Data analysts can then query a view on the diagnosis code to obtain a count of the number of patients with a unique diagnosis code. |
| Pre-load tokenized data. |  | ✔ | Unauthorized users never see the real data value. Requires third-party tokenization provider. |
| Pre-load unmasked data. | ✔ |  | Only need built-in Snowflake functionality, no third-parties required. |
| Data Sharing. | ✔ |  | For details, see [Data Sharing](#label-security-column-intro-data-sharing) (in this topic). |
| Ease of use and change management. | ✔ | ✔ | Write a policy once and have it apply to thousands of columns across databases and schemas. |
| Data administration and SoD. | ✔ | ✔ | A security or privacy officer decides which columns to protect, not the object owner.  Masking policies are easy to manage and support centralized and decentralized administration models. |
| Data authorization and governance. | ✔ | ✔ |  |
| Contextual data access by role or custom entitlements. | ✔ | ✔ | Supports data governance as implemented by security or privacy officers and can prohibit privileged users with the ACCOUNTADMIN or SECURITYADMIN system roles from unnecessarily viewing data. |
| Database replication and account object replication. | ✔ | ✔ | See: [Replication](#label-security-column-replication) (in this topic). |

### Limitations

The following table describes the current limitations for Column-level Security. A checkmark (i.e. ✔) indicates a limitation or lack of current support for the feature.

| Limitation | Dynamic Data Masking | External Tokenization | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Materialized views (MV). | ✔ | ✔ | For a complete summary, see [Materialized views](#label-security-column-intro-mv) (in this topic). |
| [DROP MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/drop-masking-policy) | ✔ | ✔ | Prior to dropping a policy, unset the policy from the table or view column using [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column) or [ALTER VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/alter-view). |
| [DROP DATABASE](/sql-reference/sql/drop-database) and [DROP SCHEMA](/sql-reference/sql/drop-schema) | ✔ | ✔ | Dropping a database or schema requires the masking policy and its mappings to be self-contained within the database or schema.  For example, `database_1` contains `policy_1` and `policy_1` is only used in `database_1`. |
| External tables. | ✔ | ✔ | An external table cannot be referenced as a lookup table (i.e. in a subquery) to determine whether column values should be masked. For more information, see [External Tables](#external-tables) (in this topic) |
| Different data types in the input and output of a policy definition. | ✔ | ✔ | A masking policy definition must have the same data type for the input and output. In other words, as a representative example, you cannot define the input datatype as a timestamp and return a string. |
| Masking policy change management. | ✔ | ✔ | You can optionally store and track masking policy changes in a version control system of your choice. |
| [Future grants](/sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege#label-grant-privilege-role-limitations). | ✔ | ✔ | [Future grants](/sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege#label-grant-privilege-schema-future-grants) of privileges on masking policies are not supported.  As a workaround, grant the [APPLY MASKING POLICY](#label-security-column-privileges-masking-policies) privilege to a custom role to allow that role to apply masking policies on table or view columns. |

### Considerations

- Use caution when inserting values from a source column that has a masking policy on the source column to a target column without a masking policy on the target column. Since a masking policy is set on the source column, a role that views unmasked column data can insert unmasked data into another column, where any role with sufficient privileges on the table or view can see the value.
- If a role that sees masked data in the source column inserts those values into a target column, the inserted values remain masked. If a masking policy is not set on the target column, then users with sufficient privileges on the table or view may see a combination of masked and unmasked values in the target column. Therefore, as a best practice:

  - Exercise caution when applying masking policies to columns.
  - Verify queries using columns that have masking policies before making tables and views available to users.
  - Determine additional tables and views (i.e. target columns) where the data in the source column may appear.
  - For more information, see [Obtain Columns with a Masking Policy](#obtain-columns-with-a-masking-policy) (in this topic).
- Use caution when creating the setup script for a Snowflake Native App when the masking policy exists in a versioned schema. For details, see
  [version schema considerations](/developer-guide/native-apps/creating-setup-script#label-setup-script-versioned-schema-failures).

## Using Column-level Security on tables and views

Snowflake supports masking policies with tables and views. The following describes how masking policies affect tables and views in
Snowflake.

Tip

Call the [POLICY\_CONTEXT](/sql-reference/functions/policy_context) function to simulate a query on a column that is protected by a masking
policy, a table or view protected by a row access policy, or both types of policies. You can also simulate
[SYS\_CONTEXT](/sql-reference/functions/sys_context) namespace values, such as activated roles and agent types.

### Active role hierarchy & mapping tables

The policy conditions can evaluate the user’s active primary and secondary roles in a session directly, look up active roles in a mapping
table, or do both depending on how the policy administrator wants to write the policy. If the policy contains a mapping table lookup,
create a centralized mapping table and store the mapping table in the same database as the protected table. This is particularly important
if the policy calls the [IS\_DATABASE\_ROLE\_IN\_SESSION](/sql-reference/functions/is_database_role_in_session) function. For details, see the function
[usage notes](/sql-reference/functions/is_database_role_in_session#label-is-db-role-in-session-notes).

For these use cases, Snowflake recommends writing the policy conditions to call the [IS\_ROLE\_IN\_SESSION](/sql-reference/functions/is_role_in_session) or
the [IS\_DATABASE\_ROLE\_IN\_SESSION](/sql-reference/functions/is_database_role_in_session) function depending on whether you want to specify an account role or
database role. For examples, see:

- [Examples](/sql-reference/functions/is_role_in_session#label-is-role-in-session-examples) section in the IS\_ROLE\_IN\_SESSION function.
- IS\_DATABASE\_ROLE\_IN\_SESSION
- [Share data protected by a policy](/user-guide/data-sharing-policy-protected-data)

For additional examples using context functions and masking policies, see [Advanced Column-level Security topics](/user-guide/security-column-advanced).

### Apply masking policies to columns

When a column is not protected by a masking policy, there are two options to apply a masking policy to a column in a table or view:

1. With a new table or view, apply the policy to a table column with a [CREATE TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/create-table) statement or a view
   column with a [CREATE VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/create-view) statement.
2. With an existing table or view, apply the policy to a table column with an [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column)
   statement or a view column with an [ALTER VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/alter-view) statement.

For a new table or view, execute the following statements:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> -- table
> CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE user_info (ssn string masking policy ssn_mask);
>
> -- view
> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_info_v (ssn masking policy ssn_mask_v) AS SELECT * FROM user_info;
> ```

For an existing table or view, execute the following statements:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> -- table
> ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS user_info MODIFY COLUMN ssn_number SET MASKING POLICY ssn_mask;
>
> -- view
> ALTER VIEW user_info_v MODIFY COLUMN ssn_number SET MASKING POLICY ssn_mask_v;
> ```

For more information on syntax and usage, see [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column) and [ALTER VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/alter-view).

If the masking policy uses a UDF, see [User-defined functions in a masking policy](#label-security-column-intro-udf-policy) (in this topic).

### Apply a conditional masking policy on a column

After [creating](/sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy) a masking policy using
[conditional columns](#label-security-column-intro-cond-cols), there are two options to set a conditional masking policy on a column
when the column is not already protected by a masking policy:

1. For a new table or view, apply the policy to a table or view column with the corresponding CREATE statement.

   For more information on syntax and usage, see:

   - [CREATE TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/create-table)
   - [CREATE VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/create-view)
   - [CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/create-materialized-view)

   For a new table or view, execute the following statements:

   Copy code

   ```
   -- table
   CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE user_info (email string masking policy email_visibility) USING (email, visibility);

   --view
   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_info_v (email masking policy email_visibility) USING (email, visibility) AS SELECT * FROM user_info;
   ```
2. For an existing table or view, set the policy on a table or view column with the corresponding ALTER statement.

   For more information on syntax and usage, see:

   - [ALTER TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table)
   - [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column)
   - [ALTER VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/alter-view)
   - [ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/alter-materialized-view)

   For an existing table or view, execute the following statements:

   Copy code

   ```
   -- table
   ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS user_info MODIFY COLUMN email
   SET MASKING POLICY email_visibility USING (EMAIL, VISIBILITY);

   -- VIEW
   ALTER VIEW user_info_v MODIFY COLUMN email
   SET MASKING POLICY email_visibility USING (email, visibility);
   ```

### Replace a masking policy on a column

Once a masking policy is set on a column, there are two different pathways to replace the masking policy on the column with a different
masking policy without having to replace the entire table or view.

These examples use [ALTER TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table) commands. The same approach applies to views with the
[ALTER VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/alter-view) command:

- Unset the policy from a table column in one statement and then set a new policy on the column in a different statement:

  Copy code

  ```
  ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c1 UNSET MASKING POLICY;

  ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c1 SET MASKING POLICY p2;
  ```
- Use the `FORCE` keyword to replace the policy in a single statement:

  Copy code

  ```
  ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c1 SET MASKING POLICY p2 FORCE;
  ```

  Note:

  - The `FORCE` keyword requires the [data type](/sql-reference-data-types) of the policy in the ALTER TABLE statement
    (i.e. STRING) to match the data type of the masking policy currently set on the column (i.e. STRING).
  - The `FORCE` keyword can be combined with the `USING` clause to set a conditional masking policy on column:

    Copy code

    ```
    ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c1 SET MASKING POLICY policy1 USING (c1, c3, c4) FORCE;
    ```

Important

Exercise caution when replacing a masking policy on a column.

Depending on the timing of the replacement and the query on the column, choosing to replace the policy in two separate statements could
lead to a data leak because the column data is unprotected in the time interval between the UNSET and SET operations.

However, if the policy conditions are different in the replacement policy, specifying the `FORCE` keyword could lead to a lack of
access because (previously) users could access data and the replacement no longer allows access.

Prior to replacing a policy, consult your internal data administrators to coordinate the best approach to protect data with masking
policies and replace masking policies as needed.

### Row access policies

A given table or view column can be specified in either a masking policy signature or a row access policy signature. In other words, the
same column cannot be specified in both a masking policy signature and a row access policy signature at the same time.

This behavior also applies to columns used as conditional columns in a masking policy.

For more information, see [CREATE MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy) and [CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-row-access-policy).

### Simulate how a policy will work

Call the [POLICY\_CONTEXT](/sql-reference/functions/policy_context) function to simulate a query on a column that is protected by a masking policy,
a table or view protected by a row access policy, or both types of policies. You can also simulate
[SYS\_CONTEXT](/sql-reference/functions/sys_context) namespace values, such as activated roles and agent types. For example:

Copy code

```
EXECUTE USING POLICY_CONTEXT(
  SNOWFLAKE$SESSION_ACTIVATED_ROLES => ('ANALYST', 'PUBLIC')
)
  AS SELECT * FROM empl_info;
```

For more examples, including how to simulate agent invocation contexts, see
[POLICY\_CONTEXT examples](/sql-reference/functions/policy_context#label-policy-context-examples).

### Materialized views

Snowflake lets you set a masking policy on a materialized view column. At query runtime, the query plan executes any masking policy that
is present prior to creating the materialized view rewrite. Once the materialized view rewrite occurs, masking policies cannot be set on
any materialized view columns.

There are two options to set a masking policy on a materialized view column:

1. For a new materialized view, execute a [CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/create-materialized-view) statement:

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_info_mv
     (ssn_number masking policy ssn_mask)
   AS SELECT ssn_number FROM user_info;
   ```
2. For an existing materialized view, execute an
   [ALTER VIEW … MODIFY COLUMN](/sql-reference/sql/alter-view) statement on the materialized view as shown in the
   [Apply Masking Policies to Columns](#apply-masking-policies-to-columns) section (in this topic).

Additionally, the following two limitations exist regarding masking policies and materialized views:

1. A masking policy cannot be set on a table column if a materialized view is already created from the underlying table. Snowflake returns
   the following error message when this attempt is made:

   Copy code

   ```
   SQL execution error: One or more materialized views exist on the table. number of mvs=<number>, table name=<table_name>.
   ```
2. If a masking policy is set on an underlying table column and a materialized view is created from that table, the
   materialized view only contains columns that are not protected by a masking policy. Snowflake also returns the following error message
   when attempting to include one or more columns protected by a masking policy:

   Copy code

   ```
   Unsupported feature 'CREATE ON MASKING POLICY COLUMN'.
   ```

Tip

If you prefer to set a masking policy on a column in the base table, consider creating a dynamic table from the base table. For more
information, see [Masking and row access policies](/user-guide/dynamic-tables/supported-queries#label-dynamic-tables-limits-incremental-refresh-features).

### Dynamic tables

You can create a dynamic table with a row access policy, masking policy, and tag. For more information, see:

- [CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/create-dynamic-table)
- [Masking and row access policies](/user-guide/dynamic-tables/supported-queries#label-dynamic-tables-limits-incremental-refresh-features)

### Obtain columns with a masking policy

To obtain a list of columns with masking policies, execute the following statement. For more information, see [POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/functions/policy_references).

> Copy code
>
> ```
> SELECT * from table(
>   INFORMATION_SCHEMA.POLICY_REFERENCES(
>     policy_name=>'<policy_name>'
>   )
> );
> ```

Execute a [DESCRIBE TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/desc-table) or [DESCRIBE VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/desc-view) statement to view the masking policy on a column in a table or view.

### Object Tagging and masking policies

For details, see [Tag-based masking policies](/user-guide/tag-based-masking-policies).

Note that a masking policy that is directly assigned to a column takes precedence over a tag-based masking policy.

### Hashing, cryptographic, and encryption functions in masking policies

[Hashing](/sql-reference/functions-hash-scalar) and [cryptographic/checksum](/sql-reference/functions-string) functions can be used in masking policies to mask sensitive data.

For more information, see [Advanced Column-level Security topics](/user-guide/security-column-advanced).

### External tables

You cannot assign a masking policy to the external table **VALUE** column when creating the external table with a
[CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/create-external-table) statement because this column is automatically created by default.

You can assign the masking policy to the external table **VALUE** column by executing an [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column)
statement on the external table. The data type of the masking policy that protects the VALUE column must be VARIANT.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN VALUE SET MASKING POLICY p1;
> ```

You can assign a masking policy to a virtual column in an external table as follows:

- Set the `EXEMPT_OTHER_POLICIES` masking policy property to `TRUE` in the masking policy that protects VALUE column in the external
  table.

  If this property is not already set, execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement on the masking policy that protects the VALUE column and
  specify the `EXEMPT_OTHER_POLICIES` property. The virtual column inherits the policy that protects the VALUE column, and this property
  allows the policy on the virtual column to override the inherited policy. For details, see
  [CREATE MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy).
- Assign a different masking policy to the virtual column using an ALTER TABLE command. This policy can be less strict than the policy for
  the VALUE column because the virtual column is less sensitive. The virtual column contains a lesser amount of data than the VALUE
  column; the VALUE column contains all of the data for each row in the external table.

  The data type in the policy that protects the virtual column depends on the data type of the virtual column.

Regarding conditional columns in a masking policy, a virtual column can be listed as a conditional column argument to determine whether
the first column argument should be masked or tokenized. However, a virtual column cannot be specified as the first column to mask or
tokenize.

For more information, see [CREATE MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy).

Important

Snowflake does not support using an external table as a lookup table (i.e. in a subquery) in a masking policy. While cloning a database,
Snowflake clones the masking policy, but not the external table. Therefore, the policy in the cloned database refers to a table that
is not present in the cloned database.

If the data in the external table is necessary for the policy, consider moving the external table data to a dedicated schema
within the database in which the masking policy exists prior to completing a clone operation. Update the masking policy to
reference the fully qualified table name to ensure the policy refers to a table in the cloned database.

### Streams

Masking policies on columns in a table carry over to a stream on the same table.

The result is that unauthorized users see masked data; streams created by authorized users see the data as defined by the masking policy.

For masking policies, streams use the latest table version available at the query time for any tables referenced in the policy.

### Cloned objects

The following approach helps to safeguard data from users with the SELECT privilege on the table or view when accessing a cloned object:

- Cloning an individual policy object is not supported.
- Cloning a schema results in the cloning of all policies within the schema.
- A cloned table maps to the same policies as the source table. In other words, if a policy is set on the base table or its columns, the
  policy is attached to the cloned table or its columns.
  - If a table or view exists in the source schema/database and has references to policies in the same schema/database, the cloned table or
    view is mapped to the corresponding cloned policy (in the target schema/database) instead of the policy in the source schema/database.
  - If the source table refers to a policy in a different schema (i.e. a foreign reference), then the cloned table retains the
    foreign reference.

For more information, see [CREATE <object> … CLONE](/sql-reference/sql/create-clone).

### CREATE TABLE … AS SELECT (CTAS) statements

Executing a CREATE TABLE … AS SELECT (CTAS) statement applies any masking policies on columns included in the statement before the data is populated in the new table (i.e. the applicable column data is masked in the new table). This flow is adhered to because a table created using a CTAS statement may have a different set of columns than the source objects, and Snowflake cannot apply masking policies to the new table columns implicitly.

If there is a need to copy unmasked data, use a role authorized for protected data to run the CTAS statement. After creating the new table, transfer ownership of the new table to another role and ask the masking policy administrator to apply the masking policies to the columns of the new table.

For more information, see [CREATE TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/create-table).

### Queries using aggregate functions and masked columns

It is possible to use [Aggregate functions](/sql-reference/functions-aggregation) on columns with masked data.

A representative use case is that a data analyst wants to obtain the [COUNT](/sql-reference/functions/count) for a column of social security numbers without needing to see the actual data. However, if the data analyst runs a query using [SELECT](/sql-reference/sql/select) on a masked table column, the query returns a fixed masked value. Users with the PAYROLL custom role in the current session see the unmasked data and everyone else sees masked data.

To achieve this outcome:

1. The table owner creates a view on the column that contains the aggregate function.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE VIEW ssn_count AS SELECT DISTINCT(ssn) FROM table1;
   ```
2. Grant the ANALYST role full privileges on the view. Do not grant the analyst any privileges on the table.
3. Apply a masking policy to the table column. Note that the table policy is always applied before the view policy, if there is a policy on a view column.

   Copy code

   ```
   CASE
     WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('PAYROLL') THEN val
     ELSE '***MASKED***'
   END;
   ```
4. Execute a query on the view column.

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE analyst;
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ssn) FROM v1;
   ```

### User-defined functions in a masking policy

A [UDF](/developer-guide/udf/udf-overview) can be passed into the masking policy conditions.

It is important to ensure that the data type for the table or view column, the UDF, and the masking policy match. If the data
types are different, such as having a table column and UDF with data type VARIANT and the masking policy (with this UDF in the policy
conditions) returns VARCHAR data type, Snowflake returns an error when making a query on the table column when this masking policy is set
on the table column.

For a representative example of matching the data type for a table column, UDF, and masking policy, see the *Using JavaScript
UDFs on JSON (Variant)* example in [CREATE MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy).

### Data Sharing

Usage:
:   - If the provider assigns a policy to a shared table or view and the policy conditions call the
      [CURRENT\_ROLE](/sql-reference/functions/current_role) or [CURRENT\_USER](/sql-reference/functions/current_user) function, or the policy conditions call a [secure UDF](/developer-guide/secure-udf-procedure), Snowflake returns a NULL value for the function or the UDF in the consumer account.

      The reason is that the owner of the data being shared does not typically control the users or roles in the account in which the table
      or view is being shared. As a workaround, use the [CURRENT\_ACCOUNT](/sql-reference/functions/current_account) function in the policy conditions.

      Alternatively, as a provider, write the policy conditions to call the [IS\_DATABASE\_ROLE\_IN\_SESSION](/sql-reference/functions/is_database_role_in_session)
      function and share the database role. As a consumer, grant the shared database role to an account role. For details, see
      [Share data protected by a policy](/user-guide/data-sharing-policy-protected-data).

Limitations:
:   - A data sharing provider cannot create a policy in a [reader account](data-sharing-reader-create).
    - Data sharing consumers cannot apply a policy to a shared table or view. As a workaround, import the shared database and create a local
      view from the shared table or view.
    - Data sharing consumers cannot query a shared table or view that references two different providers. For example:

      - `rap1` is a row access policy that protects the table named `t1`, where `t1` is in the share named `share1` from a provider.
      - The `rap1` policy conditions reference a mapping table named `t2`, where `t2` comes from `share2` and a different provider.
      - The consumer query on `t1` fails.
      - The provider for `t1` can query `t1`.
    - External functions:

      Snowflake returns an error if:

      - The policy assigned to a shared table or view is updated to call an external function.
      - The policy calls an external function and you attempt to assign the policy to a shared table or view.

Note

For External Tokenization, [Secure Data Sharing](/user-guide/data-sharing-intro) is not applicable because external functions
cannot be invoked in the context of a share.

### Replication

Masking policies and their assignments can be replicated using database replication and replication groups.

For [database replication](/user-guide/database-replication-considerations), the replication operation fails if either of the
following conditions is true:

- The primary database is in an Enterprise (or higher) account and contains a policy but one or more of the accounts approved for
  replication are on lower editions.
- A table or view contained in the primary database has a [dangling reference](/user-guide/database-replication-considerations#label-database-replication-dangling-references) to a
  masking policy in another database.

The dangling reference behavior for database replication can be avoided when replicating multiple databases in a
[replication group](/user-guide/account-replication-intro#label-replication-and-failover-groups).

> Note
>
> If using failover or failback actions, the Snowflake account must be Business Critical Edition or higher.
>
> For more information, see [Introduction to replication and failover across multiple accounts](/user-guide/account-replication-intro).

### Query profile

When used on a column with a masking policy, the [EXPLAIN](/sql-reference/sql/explain) command output includes the masked data, not the masking policy body.

The following example generates the EXPLAIN plan for a query on a table of employee identification numbers and social security numbers. The command in this example generates the example in JSON format.

The column containing the social security numbers has a masking policy.

Copy code

```
EXPLAIN USING JSON SELECT * FROM mydb.public.ssn_record;
```

Copy code

```
{
  "GlobalStats": {
    "partitionsTotal": 0,
    "partitionsAssigned": 0,
    "bytesAssigned": 0
  },
  "Operations": [
    [
      {
        "id": 0,
        "operation": "Result",
        "expressions": [
          "1",
          "'**MASKED**'"
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 1,
        "parent": 0,
        "operation": "Generator",
        "expressions": [
          "1"
        ]
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Unload data

Using the [COPY INTO <location>](/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location) command on a column that has a masking policy results in the masking policy being applied to the data. Therefore, unauthorized users see masked data after executing the command.

### Snowflake Native App Framework

For details about using masking policies with a Snowflake Native App, see:

- [Restrictions on sharing data content that contains policies](/developer-guide/native-apps/preparing-data-content#label-native-apps-share-policy-protected-data).
- [Define policies on proxy views](/developer-guide/native-apps/preparing-data-content#label-native-apps-policies-proxy-views).
- [Blocked context functions](/developer-guide/native-apps/redacted-content#label-native-apps-context-function-limitations).

## Managing Column-level Security

This section provides information useful for determining your overall management approach to masking policies, describes the privileges required to manage Column-level Security, and lists supported DDL commands.

### Choosing a centralized, hybrid, or decentralized approach

To manage Dynamic Data Masking and External Tokenization policies effectively, it is helpful to consider whether your approach to masking data in columns should follow a centralized security approach, a decentralized approach, or a hybrid of each of these two approaches.

The following table summarizes some of the considerations with each of these two approaches.

| Policy Action | Centralized Management | Hybrid Management | Decentralized Management |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Create policies | Security officer | Security officer | Individual teams |
| Apply policies to columns | Security officer | Individual teams | Individual teams |

As a best practice, Snowflake recommends that your organization gathers all relevant stakeholders to determine the best management approach for implementing Column-level Security in your environment.

### Masking policy privileges

This section describes the Column-level Security masking policy privileges and how they apply to a centralized, decentralized, or hybrid management approach.

Snowflake provides the following privileges for Column-level Security masking policies.

Operating on an object in a schema requires at least one privilege on the parent database and at least one privilege on the parent schema.

| Privilege | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| APPLY | Enables executing the unset and set operations for a [masking policy](/user-guide/security-column-intro) on a column.  Note that granting the global APPLY MASKING POLICY privilege (i.e. APPLY MASKING POLICY on ACCOUNT) enables executing the DESCRIBE operation on tables and views.  For syntax examples, see [Masking policy privileges](/user-guide/security-column-intro#label-security-column-privileges-masking-policies). |
| OWNERSHIP | Grants full control over the masking policy. Required to alter most properties of a masking policy. Only a single role can hold this privilege on a specific object at a time. |

Expand

Show lessSee more

Note

Operating on a masking policy also requires USAGE or any other privilege on the parent database and schema.

The following examples show how granting privileges apply to different management approaches. After granting the APPLY privilege to a role, the masking policy can be set on a table column using an [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column) statement or set on a view column using an [ALTER VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/alter-view) statement (by a member of the role with the APPLY privilege on the masking policy).

**Centralized Management**

> In a centralized management approach, only the security officer custom role (e.g. `security_officer`) creates and applies masking policies to columns in tables or views. This approach can provide the most consistency in terms of masking policy management and masking sensitive data.

> >
> >       For more details, see [Identifier requirements](/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax).

**Hybrid Management**

> In a hybrid management approach, the security officer custom role (e.g. `security_officer`) creates masking policies and individual teams (e.g. finance, payroll, human resources) apply the masking policies to columns in tables or views owned by the teams. This approach can lead to consistent policy creation and maintenance but requires individual teams to have the increased responsibility to mask sensitive data.

**Decentralized Approach**

> In a decentralized management approach, individual teams create and apply masking policies to columns in tables or views. This approach can lead to inconsistent policy management, with the possibility of sensitive data not being masked properly, since individual teams assume all responsibility for managing masking policies and masking sensitive data.
>
> In this representative example, the support team (i.e. users with the custom role SUPPORT) and the finance team (i.e. users with the custom role FINANCE) can create masking policies. Note that these custom roles may not include the SECURITY\_OFFICER custom role.

### Masking policy DDL

Snowflake provides the following set of commands to manage Column-level Security masking policies.

- [CREATE MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy)
- [ALTER MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/alter-masking-policy) (see also: [ALTER TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table), [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column), and [ALTER VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/alter-view))
- [DROP MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/drop-masking-policy)
- [SHOW MASKING POLICIES](/sql-reference/sql/show-masking-policies)
- [DESCRIBE MASKING POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/desc-masking-policy)

The following table summarizes the relationship between the Column-level Security masking policy DDL operations and their necessary privileges.

Operating on an object in a schema requires at least one privilege on the parent database and at least one privilege on the parent schema.

| Operation | Privilege |
| --- | --- |
| Create masking policy | A role with the CREATE MASKING POLICY on SCHEMA privilege. |
| Alter masking policy | The masking policy owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the masking policy). |
| Drop masking policy | The masking policy owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the masking policy). |
| Show masking policies | One of the following:   A role with the global APPLY MASKING POLICY privilege, or   The masking policy owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the masking policy) or   A role with the APPLY privilege on the masking policy. |
| Describe masking policy | One of the following:   A role with the global APPLY MASKING POLICY privilege or   The masking policy owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the masking policy) or   A role with the APPLY privilege on the masking policy. |
| List of columns having a masking policy | One of the following:   The role with the APPLY MASKING POLICY privilege, or   The role with the APPLY on MASKING POLICY privilege on a given masking policy and has OWNERSHIP on the target object. |
| Using UDFs in a masking policy | If creating a new or altering an existing masking policy, the policy administrator role must have usage on the UDF, all scalar UDFs in the policy expression should have the same data type, and the UDF must exist.  At the query runtime, Snowflake verifies if the UDF exists; if not, the SQL expression will not resolve and the query fails. |

## Monitor masking policies with SQL

You can monitor masking policy usage through two different Account Usage views and an Information Schema table.

It can be helpful to think of two general approaches to determine how to monitor masking policy usage.

- [Discover Masking Policies](#discover-masking-policies)
- [Identify Assignments](#identify-assignments)

### Discover masking policies

You can use the [MASKING\_POLICIES](/sql-reference/account-usage/masking_policies) view in the Account Usage schema of the shared
SNOWFLAKE database. This view is a *catalog* for all masking policies in your Snowflake account. For example:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.MASKING_POLICIES
> ORDER BY POLICY_NAME;
> ```

### Identify assignments

Snowflake supports different options to identify masking policy assignments, depending on whether the query needs to target the account
or a specific database.

- Account-level query:

  Use the Account Usage [POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/account-usage/policy_references) view to determine all of the columns
  that have a masking policy. For example:

  Copy code

  ```
  SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.POLICY_REFERENCES
  ORDER BY POLICY_NAME, REF_COLUMN_NAME;
  ```
- Database-level query:

  Every Snowflake database includes an [Snowflake Information Schema](/sql-reference/info-schema). Use the Information Schema table function
  [POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/functions/policy_references) to determine all of the masking policies on columns for a given table:

  Copy code

  ```
  SELECT *
  FROM TABLE(
    my_db.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.POLICY_REFERENCES(
   'my_table',
   'table'
    )
  );
  ```

  You can also use this function to query by the name of the masking policy to find the objects that are associated with a
  given masking policy.

## Monitor masking policies with Snowsight

You can use the Snowsight **Governance & security** » **Tags & policies** area to monitor and report on the usage of
policies and tags with tables, views, and columns. There are two different interfaces: **Dashboard** and **Tagged Objects**.

When using the **Dashboard** and the **Tagged Objects** interface, note the following details.

- The **Dashboard** and **Tagged Objects** interfaces require a running warehouse.
- Snowsight updates the **Dashboard** every 12 hours.
- The **Tagged Objects** information latency can be up to two hours and returns up to 1000 objects.

# Accessing the Governance area in Snowsight

To access the **Tags & policies** area, your Snowflake account must be [Enterprise Edition or higher](/user-guide/intro-editions).
Additionally, you must do either of the following:

- Use the ACCOUNTADMIN role.
- Use an account role that is directly granted the GOVERNANCE\_VIEWER and OBJECT\_VIEWER database roles.

  You must use an account role with these database role grants. Currently, Snowsight does not evaluate role hierarchies
  and user-defined database roles that have access to tables, views, data access policies, and tags.

  To determine if your account role is granted these two database roles, use a [SHOW GRANTS](/sql-reference/sql/show-grants) command:

  > Copy code
  >
  > ```
  > SHOW GRANTS LIKE '%VIEWER%' TO ROLE data_engineer;
  > ```
  >
  > ```
  > |-------------------------------+-----------+---------------+-----------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------------+------------|

  If your account role is not granted either or both of these database roles, use the [GRANT DATABASE ROLE](/sql-reference/sql/grant-database-role) command
  and run the SHOW GRANTS command again to confirm the grants:

  > Copy code
  >
  > ```
  > USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
  > GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.GOVERNANCE_VIEWER TO ROLE data_engineer;
  > GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.OBJECT_VIEWER TO ROLE data_engineer;
  > SHOW GRANTS LIKE '%VIEWER%' TO ROLE data_engineer;
  > ```

  For details about these database roles, see [SNOWFLAKE database roles](/sql-reference/snowflake-db-roles).

## Dashboard

As a data administrator, you can use the **Dashboard** interface to monitor tag and policy usage in the following ways.

- Coverage: specifies the count and percentage based on whether a table, view, or column has a policy or tag.
- Prevalence: lists and counts the most frequently used policies and tags.

The coverage and prevalence provide a snapshot as to how well the data is protected and tagged.

When you select a count number, percentage, policy name, or tag name, the **Tagged Objects** interface opens. The **Tagged Objects**
interface updates the filters automatically based on your selection in the **Dashboard**.

The monitoring information is an alternative or complement to running complex and query-intensive operations on multiple Account
Usage views.

These views might include, but are not limited to, the [COLUMNS](/sql-reference/account-usage/columns),
[POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/account-usage/policy_references), [TABLES](/sql-reference/account-usage/tables),
[TAG\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references), and [VIEWS](/sql-reference/account-usage/views) views.

## Tagged Objects

As a data administrator, you can use this table to associate the coverage and prevalence in the **Dashboard** to a list of specific
tables, view, or columns quickly. You can also filter the table results manually as follows.

- Choose **Tables** or **Columns**.
- For tags, you can filter with tags, without tags, or by a specific tag.
- For policies, you can filter with policies, without policies, or by a specific policy.

When you select a row in the table, the **Table Details** or **Columns** tab in **Catalog** » **Database Explorer** opens. You can edit
the tag and policy assignments as needed.

Tip

You can use Snowsight to troubleshoot masking policy assignments. In the **Columns** tab, the **MASKING POLICY** column
shows **Policy Error** when there is a conflict with the masking policy assignment on the column. You can select the **Policy
Error** for more information.

Additionally, the **Data Preview** tab does not render a data preview when there is a error with a masking policy assignment on a
column. Instead, the **Data Preview** tab returns the SQL error message. This message corresponds to one of the error values in the
POLICY\_STATUS column of the Account Usage POLICY\_REFERENCES view and the Information Schema POLICY\_REFERENCES table function.

To correct the error, use the SQL error message and the **Policy Error** message to modify the tag or policy assignment.
