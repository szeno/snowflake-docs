# Aggregation policies

[Enterprise Edition Feature](/user-guide/intro-editions)

This feature requires Enterprise Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).

An aggregation policy is a schema-level object that controls what type of query can access data from a table or view. When an aggregation
policy is applied to a table, queries against that table must aggregate data into groups of a minimum size in order to return results,
thereby preventing a query from returning information from an individual record. A table or view with an aggregation policy assigned to it
is said to be *aggregation-constrained*.

Aggregation policies can be used with or without an entity key. When aggregation policies are used without an entity key, they protect the
privacy of individual rows in the data set (that is, row-level privacy). If you use an aggregation policy with an entity key, it protects
the privacy of an entity, even if information about that entity appears in multiple rows (that is, entity-level privacy).

For more information about combining aggregation policies with an entity key, see [Implementing entity-level privacy with aggregation policies](/user-guide/aggregation-policies-entity-privacy).

## Overview

A core feature of Snowflake is the ability to share data sets with other entities. Aggregation policies allow a provider (data owner) to
exercise control over what can be done with their data even after it is shared with a consumer. Specifically, the provider can require a
consumer of a table to aggregate the data rather than retrieve individual records.

When creating an aggregation policy, the provider’s policy administrator specifies a minimum group size (that is, the number of rows that must
be aggregated together into a group). The larger the minimum group size, the less likely it is that a consumer could use the query results
to deduce the contents of a single record.
Once the aggregation policy is applied to a table or view, a query against it must conform to two requirements:

- The query must aggregate the data. If the query uses an aggregation function, it must be one of the
  [allowed aggregation functions](/user-guide/aggregation-policies#label-agg-policy-allowed-functions).
- Each group created by the query must include the aggregate of at least X records, where X is the minimum group size of the aggregation
  policy.

If the query returns a group that contains fewer records than the minimum group size of the policy, then Snowflake combines those groups
into a *remainder group*. Snowflake applies the aggregation function to the appropriate column to return a value for the remainder group.
However, because that value is calculated from rows that belong to more than one group, the value of the GROUP BY key column is NULL. For
example, if the query includes the clause `GROUP BY state`, then the value of `state` in the remainder group is NULL.

A query that does not return enough results to populate a remainder group still works, but returns a NULL value in every field of the
results.

### Limitations

- You cannot protect an external table with an aggregation policy.
- If the query uses an explicit grouping construct, it must be a [GROUP BY](/sql-reference/constructs/group-by) clause. The query cannot use
  related constructs like [GROUP BY ROLLUP](/sql-reference/constructs/group-by-rollup), [GROUP BY CUBE](/sql-reference/constructs/group-by-cube), or [GROUP BY GROUPING SETS](/sql-reference/constructs/group-by-grouping-sets).
- Most [set operators](/sql-reference/operators-query) are not allowed when one of the queries acts on an
  aggregation-constrained table. As an exception, UNION ALL is supported, but each result group must satisfy the minimum group size of the
  aggregation-constrained tables being queried (see [Query requirements](#label-aggregation-policy-query-reqs) for details).
- If a column of an aggregation-constrained table is protected by a [projection policy](/user-guide/projection-policies), a query
  against that table cannot use the column as an argument of the COUNT function.
- [Recursive CTEs](/user-guide/queries-cte#label-recursive-common-table-expression) are not allowed in queries against an aggregation-constrained table or
  view.
- [Window functions](/sql-reference/functions-window) are not allowed in queries against an aggregation-constrained table or view.
- A query against an aggregation-constrained table cannot use a [correlated subquery](/user-guide/querying-subqueries#label-correlated-vs-uncorrelated-subqueries)
  or [lateral join](/sql-reference/constructs/join-lateral) when there are references to or from the portion of the query that meets
  the requirements of the aggregation policy. The following examples illustrate the types of queries that are prohibited.

  Example 1
  :   Assuming `protected_table` is aggregation-constrained, the following query is not allowed because the portion of the query that
      aggregates data references another part of the query outside of the subquery:

      Copy code

      ```
      SELECT c1, c2
      FROM open_table
      WHERE c1 = (SELECT x FROM protected_table WHERE y = open_table.c2);
      ```

  Example 2
  :   Assuming `protected_table` is aggregation-constrained, the following query is not allowed because the subquery references the part of
      the query that aggregates data, which is outside of the subquery:

      Copy code

      ```
      SELECT
        SUM(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM open_table ot WHERE pt.id = ot.id)
      FROM protected_table pt;
      ```

### Considerations

Consider the following when using aggregation policies to protect sensitive data:

- Aggregation policies protect data for an individual record, not an entity. If a data set contains multiple records belonging to the same
  entity, an aggregation policy only protects the privacy of a specific record pertaining to that entity, not the entire entity.
- While aggregation policies limit access to individual records, they do not guarantee a malicious actor could not use deliberate queries
  to obtain potentially sensitive data from an aggregation-constrained table. With enough query attempts, a malicious actor
  could potentially work around the aggregation requirements to ascertain a value from an individual row.
  Aggregation policies are best suited for use with partners and customers with whom you have an existing level of trust. In addition,
  providers should be vigilant about potential misuses of their data (for example, reviewing the access history for their
  listings).

## Create an aggregation policy

The syntax for creating an aggregation policy is:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] AGGREGATION POLICY <name>
>   AS () RETURNS AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT -> <body>
>   [ COMMENT = '<string_literal>' ];
> ```

Where:

- `name` specifies the name of the policy.
- `AS () RETURNS AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT` is the signature and return type of the policy. The signature does not accept any arguments
  and the return type is AGGREGATION\_CONSTRAINT, which is an internal data type. All aggregation policies have the same signature and return
  type.
- `body` is a SQL expression that determines the restrictions of an aggregation policy.

### Calling functions from the body

The body of an aggregation policy uses two functions to define the constraints of the policy: [NO\_AGGREGATION\_CONSTRAINT](/user-guide/aggregation-policies#label-aggregation-policy-no-aggregation-constraint) and [AGGREGATION\_CONSTRAINT](/user-guide/aggregation-policies#label-aggregation-policy-aggregation-constraint). When the conditions of the body call one of these functions, the return value from the function determines how
queries against the aggregation-constrained table or view must be formulated to return results.

NO\_AGGREGATION\_CONSTRAINT
:   Use the body’s expression to call the NO\_AGGREGATION\_CONSTRAINT function when you want a query to have unrestricted access to the table
    or view to which the aggregation policy is assigned.

AGGREGATION\_CONSTRAINT
:   Use the body’s expression to call the AGGREGATION\_CONSTRAINT function to require that queries aggregate data in order to return results.
    Use the MIN\_GROUP\_SIZE argument to specify how many rows or [entities](/user-guide/aggregation-policies-entity-privacy) must be
    included in each aggregation group.

For the complete syntax for the NO\_AGGREGATION\_CONSTRAINT and AGGREGATION\_CONSTRAINT functions, see
[CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-aggregation-policy).

Note

The body of an aggregation policy cannot reference a user-defined function, table, or view.

### Example policies

Fixed minimum group size
:   The simplest aggregation policy calls the AGGREGATION\_CONSTRAINT function directly and defines a constant minimum group size that is
    applied to all queries against the table. For example, the following command creates an aggregation policy with a minimum group size of 5:

    > Copy code
    >
    > ```
    > CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY my_agg_policy
    >   AS () RETURNS AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT -> AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT(MIN_GROUP_SIZE => 5);
    > ```

Conditional policy
:   Policy administrators can define the SQL expression of an aggregation policy so different queries have different restrictions based on
    factors such as the role of the user executing the query. This strategy can allow one user to query a table without restriction while
    requiring others to aggregate results.

    For example, the following aggregation policy gives users with the role `ADMIN` unrestricted access to a table while requiring all
    other queries to aggregate data into groups of at least 5 rows or entities.

    Copy code

    ```
    CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY my_agg_policy
      AS () RETURNS AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT ->
        CASE
          WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'ADMIN'
            THEN NO_AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT()
          ELSE AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT(MIN_GROUP_SIZE => 5)
        END;
    ```

    Tip

    You can use the following strategies when using context functions like [CURRENT\_ROLE](/sql-reference/functions/current_role) in a conditional
    policy:

    - Context functions return strings, so comparisons using them are case-sensitive. You can use
      [LOWER](/sql-reference/functions/lower) to convert strings to all lowercase if you’d like to do a case-insensitive comparison.
    - The [POLICY\_CONTEXT](/sql-reference/functions/policy_context) function helps you evaluate whether a policy body is returning the correct value
      when a context function or [SYS\_CONTEXT](/sql-reference/functions/sys_context) property returns a certain value. The
      POLICY\_CONTEXT function simulates query results based upon a specified value of one or more context functions or SYS\_CONTEXT
      namespace properties, such as activated roles and agent types.

When an agent is active in the execution context
:   When an agent is active in the execution context, you can use [IS\_AGENT\_ACTIVATED](/sql-reference/functions/is_agent_activated) in an
    aggregation policy to require aggregation even when the user’s role would otherwise allow unaggregated access. When no agent is active, the
    `ADMIN` custom role can query without aggregation:

    Copy code

    ```
    CREATE OR REPLACE AGGREGATION POLICY agg_when_agent AS ()
      RETURNS AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT ->
      CASE
        WHEN SYS_CONTEXT('SNOWFLAKE$CURRENT', 'IS_AGENT_ACTIVATED')::BOOLEAN = TRUE
          THEN AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT(MIN_GROUP_SIZE => 5)
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'ADMIN'
          THEN NO_AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT()
        ELSE AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT(MIN_GROUP_SIZE => 5)
      END;
    ```

## Modify an aggregation policy

You can use the [ALTER AGGREGATION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/alter-aggregation-policy) command to modify the SQL expression that determines the minimum group
size of the aggregation policy. You can also rename the policy or change its comment.

Before modifying an aggregation policy, you can execute the [DESCRIBE AGGREGATION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/desc-aggregation-policy) command or
[GET\_DDL](/sql-reference/functions/get_ddl) function to review the current SQL expression of the policy. The SQL expression that determines the
minimum group size appears in the `BODY` column.

As an example, you can execute the following command to change the SQL expression of the aggregation policy `my_policy` to require a
minimum group size of 2 rows in all circumstances:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER AGGREGATION POLICY my_policy SET BODY -> AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT(MIN_GROUP_SIZE=>2);
> ```

## Assign an aggregation policy

Once created, an aggregation policy can be applied to one or more tables or views to make it aggregation-constrained. A table or view can
only have one aggregation policy attached.

Use the SET AGGREGATION POLICY clause of a [ALTER TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table) or [ALTER VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/alter-view) command to assign
an aggregation policy to an existing table or view:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER { TABLE | VIEW } <name> SET AGGREGATION POLICY <policy_name> [ FORCE ]
> ```

Where:

- `name` specifies the name of the table or view.
- `policy_name` specifies the name of the aggregation policy.
- `FORCE` is an optional parameter that allows the command to assign the aggregation policy to a table or view that already has an
  aggregation policy assigned to it. The new aggregation policy atomically replaces the existing one.

For example, to assign the policy `my_agg_policy` to the table `t1`, execute:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER TABLE t1 SET AGGREGATION POLICY my_agg_policy;
> ```

You can also use the WITH clause of the [CREATE TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/create-table) and [CREATE VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/create-view) commands to assign
an aggregation policy to a table or view at creation time. For example, to assign the policy `my_agg_policy` to a new table, execute:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> CREATE TABLE t1 WITH AGGREGATION POLICY my_agg_policy;
> ```

### Replace an aggregation policy

The recommended method of replacing an aggregation policy is to use the `FORCE` parameter to detach the existing aggregation policy and
assign the new one in a single command. This allows you to atomically replace the old policy, leaving no gap in protection.

For example, to assign a new aggregation policy to a table that is already aggregation-constrained:

Copy code

```
ALTER TABLE privacy SET AGGREGATION POLICY agg_policy_2 FORCE;
```

You can also detach the aggregation policy from a table or view in one statement (… UNSET AGGREGATION POLICY) and then set a new policy
on the table or view in a different statement (… SET AGGREGATION POLICY <name>). If you choose this method, the table is not protected by an
aggregation policy in between detaching one policy and assigning another. A query could potentially access sensitive data during this time.

## Detach an aggregation policy

Use the UNSET AGGREGATION POLICY clause of an ALTER TABLE or ALTER VIEW command to detach an aggregation policy from a table or view in
order to remove the need to aggregate data. The name of the aggregation policy is not required because a table or view cannot have more than
one aggregation policy attached.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER {TABLE | VIEW} <name> UNSET AGGREGATION POLICY
> ```

Where:

- `name` specifies the name of the table or view.

For example, to detach an aggregation policy from view `v1`, execute:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER VIEW v1 UNSET AGGREGATION POLICY;
> ```

## View aggregation policies with Snowsight

To determine whether a table or view has an aggregation policy, do the following:

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Catalog** » **Database Explorer**, and then select the table or view.
3. On the **Table Details** tab, find the **Policies** section and look for an aggregation policy.
4. To determine the minimum group size of the aggregation policy, find the **Minimum Group Size** field. If the body of the policy is
   complex and has a different minimum group size under different conditions, `Case dependent` displays instead of a number. For a complex
   body, you can hover over the name of the aggregation policy to view its body to help determine its minimum group size.
5. To determine the columns of the table that combine to make up an entity key, find the **Entity Key Columns** field. If there is more
   than one entity key for the table or view, the policy appears multiple times in the **Policies** section, once for each entity key.

## Monitor aggregation policies

It can be helpful to think of two general approaches to determine how to monitor aggregation policy usage.

- [Discover aggregation policies](#discover-aggregation-policies)
- [Identify aggregation policy references](#label-aggregation-constraint-policy-refs)

### Discover aggregation policies

You can use the [AGGREGATION\_POLICIES](/sql-reference/account-usage/aggregation_policies) view in the Account Usage schema of the shared
SNOWFLAKE database. This view is a *catalog* for all aggregation policies in your Snowflake account. For example:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.AGGREGATION_POLICIES
> ORDER BY POLICY_NAME;
> ```

### Identify aggregation policy references

The [POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/functions/policy_references) Information Schema table function can identify aggregation policy references. There
are two different syntax options:

1. Return a row for each object (that is, table or view) that has the specified aggregation policy set on it:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE DATABASE my_db;
   USE SCHEMA information_schema;
   SELECT policy_name,
       policy_kind,
       ref_entity_name,
       ref_entity_domain,
       ref_column_name,
       ref_arg_column_names,
       policy_status
   FROM TABLE(information_schema.policy_references(policy_name => 'my_db.my_schema.aggpolicy'));
   ```
2. Return a row for each policy assigned to the table named `my_table`:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE DATABASE my_db;
   USE SCHEMA information_schema;
   SELECT policy_name,
       policy_kind,
       ref_entity_name,
       ref_entity_domain,
       ref_column_name,
       ref_arg_column_names,
       policy_status
   FROM TABLE(information_schema.policy_references(ref_entity_name => 'my_db.my_schema.my_table', ref_entity_domain => 'table'));
   ```

## Query requirements

After an aggregation policy has been applied to a table or view, queries against that table or view must conform to certain requirements.
This section discusses what is and isn’t allowed in a query against an aggregation-constrained table or view.

Note

Once part of the query properly aggregates data to satisfy the requirements of the aggregation policy, these query restrictions do not
apply, and another part of the query can include things that are otherwise prohibited.

For example, the following query can use a SELECT statement that does not aggregate results because another part of the query has already satisfied the aggregation requirements of the policy that is assigned to `protected_table`:

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM open_table ot WHERE ot.a > (SELECT SUM(id) FROM protected_table pt)
```

For additional restrictions on what can be included in a query, refer to [Limitations](#label-aggregation-limitations).

Aggregation functions
:   The following aggregation functions are allowed in a query against an aggregation-constrained table:

    - [AVG](/sql-reference/functions/avg)
    - [COUNT [DISTINCT]](/sql-reference/functions/count)
    - [HLL](/sql-reference/functions/hll)
    - [SUM](/sql-reference/functions/sum)

    A query can contain more than one of these allowed aggregation functions. A query fails if it attempts to use an aggregation
    function that is not allowed.

    If you wish to use a preprocessing function within an aggregation function, only the following preprocessing functions are supported:

    So, for example:

    - `SELECT myfunc(C1), COUNT(C2) FROM t1 GROUP BY 1;` is valid, because any non-aggregation function is supported at the top level of
      an aggregation policy.
    - `SELECT C1, COUNT(myfunc(C2)) FROM t1 GROUP BY 1;` is invalid because only functions listed above are supported within an aggregation
      function in an aggregation policy.

Grouping statement
:   A query against an aggregation-constrained table must aggregate data into groups of a minimum size. It can use an explicit grouping
    statement (that is, a GROUP BY clause) or a scalar aggregation function that aggregates the entire data set (for example, `COUNT(*)`).

Filters
:   In general, Snowflake does not restrict how a query uses WHERE and ON clauses to filter the aggregation-constrained table as long as it
    aggregates the rows selected by the filter.

Joins
:   A query can join an aggregation-constrained table with another table, including another aggregation-constrained table.

    Snowflake checks each aggregation group to make sure that the number of rows taken from an aggregation-constrained table meets or exceeds
    the minimum group size of that table. For example, if an aggregation-constrained table `table_a` with a minimum group size of 5 is
    joined with `table_b` with a minimum group size of 3, each group returned by the query must be created using at least 5 rows from
    `table_a` and 3 rows from `table_b`.

    Whether a query with a join meets the requirements of an aggregation-constrained table is determined by the number of rows taken from the
    table, not the size of a group. As a result, the size of a group created from the joined data could be greater than the minimum group
    size of the aggregation-constrained table, but still result in filtered data. For example, suppose:

    - `agg_t` is aggregation constrained with a minimum group size of 2. This table contains a single integer column `c` that has the
      following content: { `1`, `2`, `2` }.
    - `open_t` is unconstrained, and contains an integer column `c` with the following content: { `1`, `1`, `1`, `2` }.

    A user executes the following query that joins the two tables:

    Copy code

    ```
    SELECT c, COUNT(*)
    FROM agg_t, open_t
    WHERE agg_t.c = open_t.c
    GROUP BY agg_t.c;
    ```

    The query returns:

    ```
    +-----------------+
    |  c   | COUNT(*) |
    |------+----------|
    |  2   |  2       |
    |------+----------|
    | null |  3       |
    +-----------------+
    ```

    Even though the second group has 3 records, which is greater than the minimum group size, all of those records correspond to a single
    record in the aggregation-constrained table, so the value is filtered out.

UNION ALL
:   A query can use [UNION ALL](/sql-reference/operators-query#label-query-operators-union) to combine results of two subqueries, even if one or more of the queried
    tables are aggregation-constrained. Similar to joins, each group in the results must satisfy the minimum group size of every
    aggregation-constrained table being queried. For example, suppose:

    - Table `protected_table1` has a minimum group size of 2.
    - Table `protected_table2` has a minimum group size of 5.

    If you run the query:

    Copy code

    ```
    SELECT a, COUNT(*)
    FROM (
        SELECT a, b FROM protected_table1
        UNION ALL
        SELECT a, b FROM protected_table2
    )
    GROUP BY a;
    ```

    Each group formed by the key `a` must contain 2 records from `protected_table1` and 5 records from `protected_table2`, otherwise
    the records are placed in a remainder group.

External Functions
:   A query cannot call an [external function](/sql-reference/external-functions-introduction) unless another part of the query has
    properly aggregated results to meet the requirements of the aggregation-constrained table.

Logging & Metrics
:   A query cannot log a column of an aggregation-constrained table via UDF logging or metrics.

Data Type Conversions
:   A query that includes a data type conversion function in the SELECT statement must use the TRY version of the function. For example, the
    TRY\_CAST function is allowed, but the CAST function is prohibited. The following data type conversion functions are allowed for numeric
    types:

    - [TRY\_CAST](/sql-reference/functions/try_cast)
    - [TRY\_TO\_DECFLOAT](/sql-reference/functions/try_to_decfloat)
    - [TRY\_TO\_DECIMAL](/sql-reference/functions/try_to_decimal)
    - [TRY\_TO\_DOUBLE](/sql-reference/functions/try_to_double)
    - [TRY\_TO\_NUMBER](/sql-reference/functions/try_to_decimal)
    - [TRY\_TO\_NUMERIC](/sql-reference/functions/try_to_decimal)

PIVOT
:   A query cannot use the [PIVOT](/sql-reference/constructs/pivot) operator against a column in an aggregation-constrained table.

## Extended example

Creating an aggregation policy and assigning the aggregation policy to a table follows the same general procedure as creating and assigning
other policies, such as masking and projection policies:

1. If you are using a centralized management approach, create a custom role (for example, `agg_policy_admin`) to manage the policy. Alternatively,
   you can use an existing role.
2. Grant this role the privileges to create and assign an aggregation policy.
3. Create the aggregation policy.
4. Assign the aggregation policy to a table.

Once the aggregation policy is assigned to a table, successful queries against the table must aggregate its data.

The following extended example provides insight into each step in this process, from the provider’s access control administrator creating a
custom role to a data consumer executing a query to return aggregated results.

Access Control Administrator Tasks
:   1. Create a custom role to manage the aggregation policy. You could also re-use an existing role.

       Copy code

       ```
       USE ROLE USERADMIN;

       CREATE ROLE AGG_POLICY_ADMIN;
       ```
    2. Grant the `agg_policy_admin` custom role the privileges to create an aggregation policy in a schema and assign the aggregation policy
       to a table or view in the Snowflake account.

       This step assumes the aggregation policy will be stored in a database and schema named `privacy.agg_policies` and this database and
       schema already exist:

       Copy code

       ```
       GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE privacy TO ROLE agg_policy_admin;
       GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA privacy.agg_policies TO ROLE agg_policy_admin;

       GRANT CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY
         ON SCHEMA privacy.agg_policies TO ROLE agg_policy_admin;

       GRANT APPLY AGGREGATION POLICY ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE agg_policy_admin;
       ```

       The `agg_policy_admin` role can now be assigned to one or more users.

       For details about the privileges needed to work with aggregation policies, refer to [Privileges and commands](#label-aggregation-policy-manage)
       (in this topic).

Aggregation Policy Administrator Tasks
:   1. Create an aggregation policy to require aggregation and define a minimum group size of 3:

       Copy code

       ```
       USE ROLE agg_policy_admin;
       USE SCHEMA privacy.agg_policies;

       CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY my_policy
         AS () RETURNS AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT -> AGGREGATION_CONSTRAINT(MIN_GROUP_SIZE => 3);
       ```
    2. Assign the aggregation policy to a table `t1`:

       Copy code

       ```
       ALTER TABLE t1 SET AGGREGATION POLICY my_policy;
       ```

Consumer Query
:   Once the provider shares the aggregation-constrained table, the data consumer can execute queries against it. For this example, assume
    the aggregation-constrained table `t1` contains the following rows:

    | peak | state | elevation |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | washington | NH | 6288 |
    | cannon | NH | 4080 |
    | kearsarge | NH | 2937 |
    | mansfield | VT | 4395 |
    | killington | VT | 4229 |
    | wachusett | MA | 2006 |

    Expand

    Show lessSee more

    Now, assume that the consumer executes the following query against `t1`:

    > Copy code
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT state, AVG(elevation) AS avg_elevation
    > FROM t1
    > GROUP BY state;
    > ```

    The results are:

    > ```
    > +----------+-----------------+
    > |  STATE   |  AVG_ELEVATION  |
    > |----------+-----------------+
    > |  NH      |  4435           |
    > |  NULL    |  3543           |
    > +----------+-----------------+
    > ```

    Note that the value of `state` in the second group is `NULL` because it is a remainder group that averages the elevation of peaks in
    both `VT` and `MA`.

## Aggregation policies with Snowflake features

The following subsections briefly summarize how aggregation policies interact with various Snowflake features and services.

### Other policies

This section describes how an aggregation policy interacts with other policies, including
[masking policies](/user-guide/security-column-intro),
[row access policies](/user-guide/security-row-intro), and [projection policies](/user-guide/projection-policies).

You can attach other policies to an aggregation-constrained table. A successful query against the table must meet the requirements of all
policies.

If a row access policy is assigned to an aggregation-constrained table, a row excluded from the query results based on the row
access policy is not included when calculating the aggregated results.

The body of a masking policy, row access policy, or projection policy cannot reference an aggregation-constrained table, including its
columns. Similarly, the body of the other policy cannot include a UDF that references the aggregation-constrained table.

### Views and materialized views

You can assign an aggregation policy to both views and materialized views. When an aggregation policy is applied to a view, the underlying
table does not become aggregation-constrained. This base table can still be queried without restriction.

To avoid the possibility of exposing sensitive data, all aggregation-constrained views are treated as if they are
[secure views](/user-guide/views-secure) even if they are not.

Whether you can create a view from an aggregation-constrained table depends on the type of view:

> - You can create a regular view from one or more aggregation-constrained tables, however queries against that view must aggregate data in
>   a way that meets the restrictions of those base tables.
> - You cannot create a materialized view based on an aggregation-constrained table or view, nor can you assign an aggregation policy to a
>   table or view upon which a materialized view is based.

### Cloned objects

The following approach helps to safeguard data from users with the SELECT privilege on a cloned table or view that is stored in the cloned
database or schema:

- Cloning an individual aggregation policy object is not supported.
- Cloning a database results in the cloning of all aggregation policies within the database.
- Cloning a schema results in the cloning of all aggregation policies within the schema.
- A cloned table maps to the same aggregation policies as the source table.
  - When a table is cloned in the context of its parent schema cloning, if the source table has a reference to an aggregation policy in the
    same parent schema (i.e. a local reference), the cloned table will have a reference to the cloned aggregation policy.
  - If the source table refers to an aggregation policy in a different schema (i.e. a foreign reference), then the cloned table retains the
    foreign reference.

For more information, see [CREATE <object> … CLONE](/sql-reference/sql/create-clone).

### Replication

Aggregation policies and their assignments can be replicated using database replication and replication groups.

For [database replication](/user-guide/database-replication-considerations), the replication operation fails if either of the
following conditions is true:

- The primary database is in an Enterprise (or higher) account and contains a policy but one or more of the accounts approved for
  replication are on lower editions.
- A table or view contained in the primary database has a [dangling reference](/user-guide/database-replication-considerations#label-database-replication-dangling-references) to an
  aggregation policy in another database.

The dangling reference behavior for database replication can be avoided when replicating multiple databases in a
[replication group](/user-guide/account-replication-intro#label-replication-and-failover-groups).

## Privileges and commands

The following subsections provide information to help manage aggregation policies.

### Aggregation policy privileges

Snowflake supports the following privileges on the aggregation policy object.

Operating on an object in a schema requires at least one privilege on the parent database and at least one privilege on the parent schema.

| Privilege | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| APPLY | Enables the set and unset operations for an aggregation policy on a table. |
| OWNERSHIP | Transfers ownership of the aggregation policy, which grants full control over the aggregation policy. Required to alter most properties of an aggregation policy. |

### Aggregation policy DDL reference

Snowflake supports the following DDL to create and manage aggregation policies.

- [CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-aggregation-policy)
- [ALTER AGGREGATION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/alter-aggregation-policy)
- [DESCRIBE AGGREGATION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/desc-aggregation-policy)
- [DROP AGGREGATION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/drop-aggregation-policy)
- [SHOW AGGREGATION POLICIES](/sql-reference/sql/show-aggregation-policies)

### Summary of DDL commands, operations, and privileges

The following table summarizes the relationship between aggregation policy privileges and DDL operations.

Operating on an object in a schema requires at least one privilege on the parent database and at least one privilege on the parent schema.

| Operation | Privilege required |
| --- | --- |
| Create aggregation policy. | A role with the CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY privilege in the same schema. |
| Alter aggregation policy. | The role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the aggregation policy. |
| Describe aggregation policy | One of the following:   - A role with the global APPLY AGGREGATION POLICY privilege, or - A role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the aggregation policy, or - A role with the APPLY privilege on the aggregation policy. |
| Drop aggregation policy. | A role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the aggregation policy. |
| Show aggregation policies. | One of the following:   - A role with the USAGE privilege on the schema in which the aggregation policy exists, or - A role with the APPLY AGGREGATION POLICY on the account. |
| Set or unset an aggregation policy on a table. | One of the following:   - A role with the APPLY AGGREGATION POLICY privilege on the account, or - A role with the APPLY privilege on the aggregation policy and the OWNERSHIP privilege on the table or view. |

Snowflake supports different permissions to create and set an aggregation policy on an object.

1. For a centralized aggregation policy management approach in which the `aggregation_policy_admin` custom role creates and sets
   aggregation policies on all tables, the following permissions are necessary:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE securityadmin;
   GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE mydb TO ROLE aggregation_policy_admin;
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA mydb.schema TO ROLE aggregation_policy_admin;
   GRANT CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY ON SCHEMA mydb.schema TO ROLE aggregation_policy_admin;
   GRANT APPLY ON AGGREGATION POLICY ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE aggregation_policy_admin;
   ```
2. In a hybrid management approach, a single role has the CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY privilege to ensure aggregation policies are named
   consistently and individual teams or roles have the APPLY privilege for a specific aggregation policy.

   For example, the custom role `finance_role` role can be granted the permission to set the aggregation policy `cost_center` on tables
   and views the role owns (i.e. the role has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the table or view):

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE securityadmin;
   GRANT CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY ON SCHEMA mydb.schema TO ROLE aggregation_policy_admin;
   GRANT APPLY ON AGGREGATION POLICY cost_center TO ROLE finance_role;
   ```
