# Using Persisted Query Results

When a query is executed, the result is persisted (i.e. cached) for a period of time. At the end
of the time period, the result is purged from the system.

Snowflake uses persisted query results to avoid re-generating results when nothing has changed
(i.e. “retrieval optimization”). In addition, you can use persisted query results to post-process
the results (e.g. layering a new query on top of the results already calculated).

For persisted query results of all sizes, the cache expires after 24 hours.

Note that the security token used to access large persisted query results (i.e. greater than
100 KB in size) expires after 6 hours. A new token can be retrieved to access results while they
are still in cache. Smaller persisted query results do not use an access token.

Note

The token provided to the Snowflake Connector for Spark (“Spark connector”) expires after
24 hours regardless of the size of the persisted query results. The Spark connector leverages
the longer cache expiration time to avoid timeouts in some use cases.

See also [Optimizing the warehouse cache](/user-guide/performance-query-warehouse-cache), which discusses how table data may be cached
and reused by an active warehouse.

## Retrieval Optimization

If a user repeats a query that has already been run, and the data in the table(s) hasn’t changed since the last time that the query was run, then the result of the query is the same.
Instead of running the query again, Snowflake simply returns the same result that it returned previously. This can substantially reduce query time because Snowflake bypasses query
execution and, instead, retrieves the result directly from the cache.

Typically, query results are reused if all of the following conditions are met:

- The new query matches the previously executed query exactly. Any difference in syntax, including lowercase versus uppercase, or the use of table aliases, will inhibit 100% cache reuse. For example, consider the following queries, run in succession:

  Copy code

  ```
  SELECT DISTINCT(severity) FROM weather_events;
  SELECT DISTINCT(severity) FROM weather_events;
  SELECT DISTINCT(severity) FROM weather_events we;
  select distinct(severity) from weather_events;
  ```

  The first query will populate the cache, and the identical second query will benefit from 100% cache reuse. However, the third and fourth queries will not trigger cache reuse, simply because the third query introduces a table alias and the fourth query uses lowercase keywords.
- The query does not include non-reusable functions, which return different results for successive runs of the same query.
  [UUID\_STRING](/sql-reference/functions/uuid_string), [RANDOM](/sql-reference/functions/random), and [RANDSTR](/sql-reference/functions/randstr) are good examples of non-reusable functions.
- The query does not include [external functions](/sql-reference/external-functions).
- The query does not select from [hybrid tables](/user-guide/tables-hybrid).
- The table data contributing to the query result has not changed.
- The persisted result for the previous query is still available.
- The role accessing the cached results has the required privileges.

  - If the query was a SELECT query, the role executing the query must have the necessary access privileges for all
    the tables used in the cached query.
  - If the query was a SHOW query, the role executing the query must match the role that generated the cached results.
- Any configuration options that affect how the result was produced have not changed.
- The table’s micro-partitions have not changed (e.g. been reclustered or consolidated) due to changes to other data in the table.

Note

Meeting all these conditions does not guarantee that Snowflake reuses the query results.

By default, result reuse is enabled, but can be overridden at the account, user, and session level using the [USE\_CACHED\_RESULT](/sql-reference/parameters#label-use-cached-result) session parameter.

Note

Each time the persisted result for a query is reused, Snowflake resets the 24-hour retention period for the result, up to a maximum of 31 days from the date and time that the query was first
executed. After 31 days, the result is purged and the next time the query is submitted, a new result is generated and persisted.

## Post-processing Query Results

In some cases, you might want to perform further processing on the result of a query that you’ve already run. For example:

- You are developing a complex query step-by-step and you want to add a new layer on top of the previous query and run the new query without recalculating the partial results from scratch.
- The previous query was a [SHOW <objects>](/sql-reference/sql/show), [DESCRIBE <object>](/sql-reference/sql/desc), or [CALL](/sql-reference/sql/call) statement, which returns results in a form that are not easy to reuse.

  For example, you can’t call a stored procedure inside a more complex SQL statement the way you can call a function inside a SQL statement, so the only way to process the output of the stored
  procedure is to post-process the stored query results.

You can perform post-processing by using the [RESULT\_SCAN](/sql-reference/functions/result_scan) table function. The function returns the results of the previous query as a “table,” and then you can run a new query on the tabular data.

Tip

You can also use the [pipe operator](/sql-reference/operators-flow) (`->>`) instead of the RESULT\_SCAN function to process
the results of a previous command. With the pipe operator, you don’t have to display the results of the initial SELECT, SHOW, or
other command.

### Examples

Process the result of a [SHOW TABLES](/sql-reference/sql/show-tables) command and extract the following columns and rows from the result:

> - `schema_name`, `table_name`, and `rows` columns.
> - Rows for tables that are empty.
>
> Copy code
>
> ```
> SHOW TABLES;
