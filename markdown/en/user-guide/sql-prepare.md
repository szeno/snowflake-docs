# SQL Statements Supported for Preparation

Some drivers and connectors support the ability to send a SQL statement for preparation before execution. Snowflake supports
preparation for the following types of SQL statements:

- [SELECT](/sql-reference/sql/select)
- [Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands](/sql-reference/sql-dml)
- [SHOW <objects>](/sql-reference/sql/show)

Note that if a driver or connector sends other types of SQL statements for preparation, those statements will not be prepared. For
example, if you send a DDL statement for preparation and execution, Snowflake just executes the statement without preparing it.
