# Stage, pipe, and load history replication

[Standard & Business Critical Feature](/user-guide/intro-editions)

- Database and share replication are available to all accounts.
- Replication of other account objects & failover/failback require Business Critical Edition (or higher).
  To inquire about upgrading, please contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).

This topic provides information about replication support for data pipeline objects and related metadata,
including stages, storage integrations, pipes, and load history. You can replicate these objects to configure failover for ingest and ETL
pipelines across [regions](/user-guide/intro-regions) and across [cloud platforms](/user-guide/intro-cloud-platforms).

Before you get started, we recommend that you have familiarity with Snowflake support for replication and failover/failback.
For more information, see [Introduction to replication and failover across multiple accounts](/user-guide/account-replication-intro).

## Requirements

Important

If a database in a target account that you plan to use already contains stages and pipes, we recommend that you contact support
before enabling replication. When a replication or failover group in your source account includes that database, any pre-existing stages
and pipes are dropped from the database.

To replicate any external stages that use a storage integration, you must configure your replication or failover group to replicate
`STORAGE INTEGRATIONS`. Otherwise, external stages are replicated without the associated storage integration.

You can use an [ALTER REPLICATION GROUP](/sql-reference/sql/alter-replication-group) or
[ALTER FAILOVER GROUP](/sql-reference/sql/alter-failover-group) statement to modify these properties for an existing group.

If you add `INTEGRATIONS` to the `OBJECT_TYPES` list in your ALTER statement,
include any other existing objects in the list to avoid dropping those objects in the target account.
The same applies if you add `STORAGE INTEGRATIONS` to the `ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_TYPES` list.

For example:

Copy code

```
ALTER FAILOVER GROUP my_failover_group SET
  OBJECT_TYPES = ROLES, INTEGRATIONS
  ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_TYPES = API INTEGRATIONS, STORAGE INTEGRATIONS;
```

Note

Your cloud storage provider might limit replication of data pipeline objects between commercial and government cloud regions. To avoid
government cloud data replication limitations, configure your failover resources in any region accessible to your government cloud region.
For more information about government cloud limitations, review your cloud storage provider’s documentation.

## Replication and stages

This section describes the current level of replication functionality that Snowflake supports for different types of stages.

### Replication of internal stages

The following table describes how replication works for each type of internal stage.

| Type | Description of Replication Support |
| --- | --- |
| Table stage | Empty table stages are created for tables in a replicated database. Files on table stages are not replicated. |
| User stage | User and user stage replication requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).  Empty user stages are created for replicated users. Files on user stages are not replicated. |
| Named stage | Named internal stages are replicated when you replicate a database.  The stage must have a directory table enabled on it in order to replicate the files on the stage. |

### Replication of external stages

Note

Snowflake does not replicate files on an external stage.
The cloud storage URL points to the same location for external stages in primary and secondary databases.

The following table describes how replication works for each type of external stage.

| Type | Description of Replication Support |
| --- | --- |
| Named stage with no credentials (public storage location) | Named external stages are replicated when you replicate a database. The files on an external stage are not replicated. |
| Named stage with credentials (private storage location) | Replicated stages include the cloud provider credentials, such as secret keys or access tokens. |
| Named stage with storage integration (private storage location) | Storage integration replication requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).  The replication or failover group must include `STORAGE INTEGRATIONS` in the `ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_TYPES` list. For more information, see [CREATE FAILOVER GROUP](/sql-reference/sql/create-failover-group).  You must also take action to configure the trust relationships for your cloud storage in the target accounts. For more information, see [Configure cloud storage access for secondary storage integrations](/user-guide/account-replication-config#label-configure-cloud-storage-access-secondary-storage-integrations). |

Show lessSee more

Note

To associate a secondary stage or pipe with a different cloud storage location than the one associated with the primary object,
contact the support team. For example, you might choose a location in another region.

### Considerations

The following constraints apply to stage objects:

- Snowflake currently supports stage replication as part of group-based replication (replication and failover groups).
  Stage replication is not supported for database replication.
- You can replicate an external stage. However, the files on an external stage are not replicated.
- You can replicate an internal stage. To replicate the files on an internal stage, you must enable a directory table on the stage.
  Snowflake replicates only the files that are mapped by the directory table.
- When you replicate an internal stage with a directory table, you cannot disable the directory table on the primary or secondary stage.
  The directory table contains critical information about replicated files and files loaded using a COPY statement.
- A refresh operation will fail if the directory table on an internal stage contains a file that is larger than 5GB. To work around this
  limitation, move any files larger than 5GB to a different stage.

  You cannot disable the directory table on a primary or secondary stage, or any stage that has previously been replicated. Follow
  these steps *before* you add the database that contains the stage to a replication or failover group.

  1. [Disable the directory table](/sql-reference/sql/alter-stage#label-alter-stage-directory-table-syntax) on the primary stage.
  2. Move the files that are larger than 5GB to another stage that does not have a directory table enabled.
  3. After you move the files to another stage, re-enable the directory table on the primary stage.
- Files on user stages and table stages are not replicated.
- For named external stages that use a storage integration, you must configure the trust relationship for secondary storage integrations
  in your target accounts prior to failover. For more information, see [Configure cloud storage access for secondary storage integrations](/user-guide/account-replication-config#label-configure-cloud-storage-access-secondary-storage-integrations).
- If you replicate an external stage with a directory table, and you have configured
  [automated refresh](/user-guide/data-load-dirtables-auto) for the source
  directory table, you must configure automated refresh for the secondary directory table before failover. For more information,
  see [Configure automated refresh for directory tables on secondary stages](/user-guide/account-replication-config#label-configure-automated-refresh-secondary-directory-tables).
- A copy command might take longer than expected if the directory table on a replicated stage is not consistent with the
  replicated files on the stage. To make a directory table consistent, refresh it with an
  [ALTER STAGE … REFRESH](/sql-reference/sql/alter-stage) statement.
  To check the consistency status of a directory table, use the [SYSTEM$GET\_DIRECTORY\_TABLE\_STATUS](/sql-reference/functions/system_get_directory_table_status) function.

## Replication and pipes

This section describes the current level of replication functionality supported for different types of pipes.

Snowflake supports replication for the following:

- Pipe objects, including auto-ingest and REST endpoint pipes that load data from external stages.
- Pipe-level parameters.
- Privilege grants on pipe objects.

Note

To associate a secondary stage or pipe with a different cloud storage location than the one associated with the primary object,
contact the support team. For example, you might choose a location in another region.

### Pipes in secondary databases

Pipes in a secondary database are in a `READ_ONLY` execution state and receive notifications
but do not load data until you promote the secondary database to serve as the primary.
After you promote a secondary database, the pipes will transition to a `FAILING_OVER` execution state.
Once failover is complete, the pipes should be in the `RUNNING` execution state
and begin to load any data that is available since the last refresh time (that is, the last time that the former primary database was updated).

### Replication of auto-ingest pipes

In the event of a failover, a replicated auto-ingest pipe becomes the new primary pipe and can do the following:

- Load any data that has not yet been loaded.
  This includes any data that is new since the newly promoted primary database was last refreshed.
- Continue to receive notifications when the stage has new files to load, and loads data from those files.

  Note

  To receive notifications, you must configure a secondary auto-ingest pipe in a target account prior to failover.
  For more information, see [Configure notifications for secondary auto-ingest pipes](/user-guide/account-replication-config#label-configure-notifications-secondary-pipes).

### Replication of REST endpoint pipes

For pipes that use the [Snowpipe REST API](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-rest-load) to load data,
Snowflake replicates the pipes and their load history metadata to each target account that you specify.
There are no additional configuration steps you need to take on the target accounts.
For a detailed list of load history metadata, see [Load metadata](/user-guide/data-load-considerations-load#label-copy-load-metadata).

To continue data loading in the event of a failover, call the REST API from the newly-promoted source account.

### Considerations

The following constraints apply to pipe objects:

- Snowflake currently supports pipe replication as part of group-based replication (replication and failover groups).
  Pipe replication is not supported for database replication.
- Snowflake replicates the copy history of a pipe only when the pipe belongs to the same replication group as its target table.
- Replication of notification integrations is not supported.
- Snowflake only replicates load history after the latest table truncate.
- To receive notifications, you must configure a secondary auto-ingest pipe in a target account prior to failover.
  For more information, see [Configure notifications for secondary auto-ingest pipes](/user-guide/account-replication-config#label-configure-notifications-secondary-pipes).
- Use the [SYSTEM$PIPE\_STATUS](/sql-reference/functions/system_pipe_status) function to resolve any pipes not in their expected execution state after failover.
- Snowflake doesn’t support replication and failover for Snowpipe with the Kafka connector, but Snowflake does support replication and failover for Snowpipe Streaming with the Kafka connector. For more information, see [Snowpipe Streaming and the Kafka connector](/user-guide/account-replication-failover-failback#label-update-snowpipe-streaming-kafka-on-failover).

## Example 1: Replicate a named internal stage

This example demonstrates how replication works for internal stages. In particular, the example shows how the directory table
is the single source of truth for stage metadata before and after replication.

The first part of the example completes the following tasks in a source account.

1. Create an internal stage named `my_int_stage` with a directory table enabled to replicate the files on the stage. Then copy data
   from a table named `my_table` into files on the stage.

   Note

   The example refreshes the directory table after loading `file1` and `file2` onto the stage to synchronize
   the table metadata with the latest set of files in the stage definition for the directory tables.
   However, no refresh operation occurs after loading `file3`.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_stage
     DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE);

   COPY INTO @my_stage/folder1/file1 from my_table;
   COPY INTO @my_stage/folder2/file2 from my_table;
   ALTER STAGE my_stage REFRESH;

   COPY INTO @my_stage/folder3/file3 from my_table;
   ```
2. Create a failover group:

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE FAILOVER GROUP my_stage_failover_group
     OBJECT_TYPES = DATABASES
     ALLOWED_DATABASES = my_database_1
     ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS = myorg.my_account_2;
   ```

The second part of the example completes the replication and failover process in a target account:

1. Create a failover group as a replica of the failover group in the source account, refresh the objects in the new failover group,
   and promote the target account to serve as the source account.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE FAILOVER GROUP my_stage_failover_group
     AS REPLICA OF myorg.my_account_1.my_stage_failover_group;

   ALTER FAILOVER GROUP my_stage_failover_group REFRESH;

   ALTER FAILOVER GROUP my_stage_failover_group PRIMARY;
   ```
2. Next, refresh the directory table on the replicated stage and copy all of the
   files tracked by the directory table on `my_stage` into a table named `my_table` .

   Note

   The COPY INTO statement loads `file1` and `file2` into the table, but not `file3`.
   This is because the directory table was not refreshed after adding `file3` in the source account.

   Copy code

   ```
   ALTER STAGE my_stage REFRESH;

   COPY INTO my_table FROM @my_stage;
   ```

## Example 2: Replicate an external stage and storage integration

This example provides a sample workflow for replicating an external stage and storage integration to a target account.

The example assumes that you have already completed the following:
[Configured secure access to your Amazon S3 bucket](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3#label-data-load-snowpipe-secure-access-s3).

The first part of the example completes the following tasks in a source account.

1. Create a storage integration for an Amazon S3 bucket in database `my_database_2`.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION my_storage_int
     TYPE = external_stage
     STORAGE_PROVIDER = 's3'
     STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://mybucket/path')
     STORAGE_BLOCKED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://mybucket/blockedpath')
     ENABLED = true;
   ```
2. Create an external stage in database `my_database_2` using storage integration `my_storage_int`.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE STAGE my_ext_stage
     URL = 's3://mybucket/path'
     STORAGE_INTEGRATION = my_storage_int
   ```
3. Create a failover group and include database `my_database_2` and storage integration objects.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE FAILOVER GROUP my_external_stage_fg
     OBJECT_TYPES = databases, integrations
     ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_TYPES = storage integrations
     ALLOWED_DATABASES = my_database_2
     ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS = myorg.my_account_2;
   ```

The second part of the example completes the replication and failover process in a target account:

1. Create a failover group as a replica of the failover group in the source account and refresh.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE FAILOVER GROUP my_external_stage_fg
     AS REPLICA OF myorg.my_account_1.my_external_stage_fg;

   ALTER FAILOVER GROUP my_external_stage_fg REFRESH;
   ```
2. After you replicate the storage integration to the target account, you must take additional steps to update your cloud
   provider permissions to grant the replication integration access to your cloud storage. For more information, see
   [Configure cloud storage access for secondary storage integrations](/user-guide/account-replication-config#label-configure-cloud-storage-access-secondary-storage-integrations).

## Example 3: Replicate an auto-ingest pipe

This example provides a sample workflow for replicating a pipe that uses
an [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic with Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) to automate Snowpipe](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3#label-configuring-amazon-sns-for-snowpipe).

The example assumes that you have already completed the following tasks:

- [Created and configured a storage integration for Amazon S3](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3#label-data-load-snowpipe-secure-access-s3). For example
  purposes, we use a storage integration named `my_s3_storage_int`.
- [Created an Amazon SNS topic and subscription, and subscribed the Snowflake SQS queue to your SNS topic](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3#label-create-sns-topic-subscription).
- Created an external stage that references your storage integration. For example
  purposes, we use a stage named `my_s3_stage`. For instructions, see [CREATE STAGE](/sql-reference/sql/create-stage).

Start with the following tasks in a source account.

1. Use the [CREATE PIPE](/sql-reference/sql/create-pipe) command to create a pipe with auto-ingest enabled that loads data from the external stage into a table named `mytable`.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE PIPE snowpipe_db.public.mypipe AUTO_INGEST=TRUE
    AWS_SNS_TOPIC='<topic_arn>'
    AS
   COPY INTO snowpipe_db.public.mytable
   FROM @snowpipe_db.public.my_s3_stage
   FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'JSON');
   ```
2. Refresh the pipe with an [ALTER PIPE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-pipe) statement to load data from the stage from the last 7 days.

   Copy code

   ```
   ALTER PIPE mypipe REFRESH;
   ```
3. Finally, use [CREATE FAILOVER GROUP](/sql-reference/sql/create-failover-group) to create a failover group
   that allows replication of storage integrations.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE FAILOVER GROUP my_pipe_failover_group
     OBJECT_TYPES = DATABASES, INTEGRATIONS
     ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_TYPES = STORAGE INTEGRATIONS
     ALLOWED_DATABASES = snowpipe_db
     ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS = myorg.my_account_2;
   ```

The second part of the example completes the replication and failover process in a target account:

1. Create a failover group as a replica of the failover group in the source account.

   Copy code

   ```
   CREATE FAILOVER GROUP my_pipe_failover_group
     AS REPLICA OF myorg.my_account_1.my_pipe_failover_group;
   ```
2. Execute a [DESCRIBE INTEGRATION](/sql-reference/sql/desc-integration) statement to retrieve the ARN for the
   AWS IAM User for your Snowflake account on the secondary deployment.

   Use the ARN to grant the IAM user permissions to access your S3 bucket.
   [See Step 5: Grant the IAM User Permissions to Access Bucket Objects](/user-guide/data-load-s3-config-storage-integration#label-data-load-s3-storage-integration-steps).

   Copy code

   ```
   DESC INTEGRATION my_s3_storage_int;
   ```
3. Call the [SYSTEM$GET\_AWS\_SNS\_IAM\_POLICY](/sql-reference/functions/system_get_aws_sns_iam_policy) system function to generate an IAM policy that grants the new SQS queue permission
   to subscribe to your SNS topic. Snowflake created the new SQS queue in your target account when you replicated the failover group from your
   source account.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT SYSTEM$GET_AWS_SNS_IAM_POLICY('<topic_arn>');
   ```

   `topic_arn` is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic that you created for the original pipe in your source account.

   Then, [Subscribe the new Amazon SQS queue to your SNS topic](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3#label-create-sns-topic-subscription).
4. Refresh the objects in your new failover group.

   Copy code

   ```
   ALTER FAILOVER GROUP my_pipe_failover_group REFRESH;
   ```
5. Finally, promote the target account to serve as the source account with the [ALTER FAILOVER GROUP](/sql-reference/sql/alter-failover-group) command.

   Copy code

   ```
   ALTER FAILOVER GROUP my_pipe_failover_group PRIMARY;
   ```

   The `mypipe` pipe will begin to load any data that was made available since the
   last time the failover group was refreshed in the source account.

   To verify that the replicated pipe is working, query the table from the pipe’s COPY statement.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT * FROM mytable;
   ```

## Migrate to Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

This section covers how to migrate from sending Amazon S3 event notifications directly to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
queue to using an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic for the following scenarios:

- [Refresh directory tables automatically for Amazon S3](/user-guide/data-load-dirtables-auto-s3)
- [Automating Snowpipe for Amazon S3](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3)

When you replicate a directory table or pipe,
Snowflake creates a new SQS queue in your target account to handle automation. You can configure a single SNS topic to
deliver event notifications from your S3 bucket to all SQS queues across multiple accounts.
By broadcasting your S3 event notification(s) to every SQS queue, you reduce the risk of losing notifications and data after failover.

Note

If you already use SNS, migration is not necessary.
Instead, follow the usual steps to configure automation with SNS for secondary directory tables or auto-ingest pipes before failover.

- [Configure automated refresh for directory tables on secondary stages](/user-guide/account-replication-config#label-configure-automated-refresh-secondary-directory-tables)
- [Configure notifications for secondary auto-ingest pipes](/user-guide/account-replication-config#label-configure-notifications-secondary-pipes)

### Prerequisites

To migrate, you must meet the following conditions:

- You have already set up one or more event notifications for your S3 bucket. For instructions, see the topic for your use case:

  - [Refreshing Directory Tables Automatically for Amazon S3: Creating a New S3 Event Notification](/user-guide/data-load-dirtables-auto-s3#label-data-load-dirtables-auto-s3-option-1)
  - [Creating a New S3 Event Notification to Automate Snowpipe](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3#label-data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3-option-1)
- You have already created a replication or failover group in a target account that includes a stage with a directory table or a pipe.

### Migrate to an SNS Topic

1. Create an SNS topic in your AWS account.
   For instructions, see [Creating an Amazon SNS topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html)
   in the AWS SNS documentation.
2. Subscribe your target destinations (for example, other SQS queues or AWS Lambda workloads) for your S3 event notification(s)
   to your SNS topic. SNS publishes event notifications for your bucket to all subscribers to the topic.
   For instructions, see the [AWS SNS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html).
3. Update the access policy for your topic with the following permissions:

   - Allow the Snowflake IAM user to subscribe the SQS queue that is in your *target* account
     to your topic.
   - Allow Amazon S3 to publish event notifications from your bucket to the SNS topic.

   For instructions, see [Step 1: Subscribe the Snowflake SQS Queue to the SNS Topic](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3#label-create-sns-topic-subscription).
4. In your target Snowflake account, call the [SYSTEM$CONVERT\_PIPES\_SQS\_TO\_SNS](/sql-reference/functions/system_convert_pipes_sqs_to_sns) function.
   The function subscribes the SQS queue in your *target* account to your SNS topic without interrupting metadata
   synchronization or ingestion work.

   Specify your S3 bucket name and SNS topic ARN.

   Copy code

   ```
   SELECT SYSTEM$CONVERT_PIPES_SQS_TO_SNS('s3_mybucket', 'arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:001234567890:MySNSTopic')
   ```
5. Update your S3 event notifications to use your SNS topic as a destination. For instructions, see the
   [Amazon S3 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enable-event-notifications.html).

After you complete these steps, the SQS queue automatically unbinds from your S3 event notification(s).
All of the directory tables and pipes that use the specified S3 bucket will start using SNS as the source of notifications.
