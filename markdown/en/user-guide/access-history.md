# Access History

[Enterprise Edition Feature](/user-guide/intro-editions)

Access History requires Enterprise Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact
[Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).

This topic provides concepts on the user access history in Snowflake.

## Overview

Access History in Snowflake refers to when the user query reads data and when the SQL statement performs a data write
operation, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE along with variations of the COPY command, from the source data object to the target data
object. The user access history can be found by querying the ACCESS\_HISTORY view in the ACCOUNT\_USAGE and ORGANIZATION\_USAGE schemas. The
records in these views facilitate regulatory compliance auditing and provide insights on popular and frequently accessed tables and columns
because there is a direct link between the user (i.e. query operator), the query, the table or view, the column, and the data.

Each row in the ACCESS\_HISTORY view contains a single record per SQL statement. The record contains the following kinds of information:

- The *source columns* the query accessed directly and indirectly, such as the underlying tables that the data for the query comes from.
- The *projected columns* the user sees in the query result, such as the columns specified in a SELECT statement.
- The columns that are used to determine the query result but are not projected, such as columns in a WHERE clause to filter the result.

For example:

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v1 (vc1, vc2) AS
SELECT c1 as vc1,
       c2 as vc2
FROM t
WHERE t.c3 > 0
;
```

- Columns C1 and C2 are source columns that the view accesses directly, which are recorded in the `base_objects_accessed` column of
  the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.
- Column C3 is used to filter the rows the view includes, which is recorded in the `base_objects_accessed` column of
  the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.
- Columns VC1 and VC2 are projected columns the user sees when querying the view, `SELECT * FROM v1;`, which are recorded in the
  `direct_objects_accessed` column of the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.

The same behavior applies to a key column in a WHERE clause. For example:

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW join_v (vc1, vc2, c1) AS
  SELECT
      bt.c1 AS vc1,
      bt.c2 AS vc2,
      jt.c1
  FROM bt, jt
  WHERE bt.c3 = jt.c1;
```

- Two different tables are required to create the view: `bt` (base table) and `jt` (join table.).
- Columns C1, C2, and C3 from the base table and column C1 from the join table are all recorded in the `base_objects_accessed` column
  of the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.
- Columns VC1, VC2, and C1 are projected columns the user sees when querying the view, `SELECT * FROM join_v;`, which are
  recorded in the `direct_objects_accessed` column of the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.

Note

Records in the Account Usage [QUERY\_HISTORY](/sql-reference/account-usage/query_history) view do not always get recorded in the
ACCESS\_HISTORY view. The structure of the SQL statement determines whether Snowflake records an entry in the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.

For details on the read and write operations Snowflake supports in the ACCESS\_HISTORY view, refer to the view
[Usage notes](/sql-reference/account-usage/access_history#label-access-history-acctuse-usage-notes).

## Tracking read and write operations

The ACCESS\_HISTORY view in both the ACCOUNT\_USAGE and the ORGANIZATION\_USAGE schemas includes the following columns:

Copy code

```
query_id | query_start_time | user_name | direct_objects_accessed | base_objects_accessed | objects_modified | object_modified_by_ddl | policies_referenced | parent_query_id | root_query_id
```

Read operations are tracked through the first five columns, while the last column,
`objects_modified`, specifies the data write information that involved Snowflake columns, tables, and stages.

The query in Snowflake and how the database objects were created determines the information Snowflake returns in the
`direct_objects_accessed`, `base_objects_accessed`, and `objects_modified` columns.

Similarly, if the query references an object protected by a row access policy or a column protected by a masking policy, Snowflake records
the policy information in the `policies_referenced` column.

The `object_modified_by_ddl` column records the DDL operation on a database, schema, table, view, and column. These operations also
include statements that specify a row access policy on a table or view, a masking policy on a column, and tag updates
(e.g. set a tag, change a tag value) on the object or column.

The `parent_query_id` and `root_query_id` columns record query IDs that correspond to:

- A query that performs a read or write operation on another object.
- A query that performs a read or write operation on an object that calls a stored procedure, including nested stored procedure calls. For
  details, see [ancestor queries](#label-access-history-ancestor-queries) (in this topic).

For column details, see the [Columns](/sql-reference/account-usage/access_history#label-acctuse-view-access-history-columns) section in the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.

### Read

Consider the following scenario to understand a read query and how the ACCESS\_HISTORY view records this information:

- A series of objects: `base_table` » `view_1` » `view_2` » `view_3`.
- A read query on `view_2`, such as:

  Copy code

  ```
  select * from view_2;
  ```

In this example, Snowflake returns:

- `view_2` in the `direct_objects_accessed` column because the query specifies `view_2`.
- `base_table` in the `base_objects_accessed` column because that is the original source of the data in `view_2`.

Note that `view_1` and `view_3` are not included in the `direct_objects_accessed` and `base_objects_accessed` columns
because neither of those views were included in the query and they are not the base object that serves as the source for the data in
`view_2`.

### Write

Consider the following scenario to understand a write operation and how the ACCESS\_HISTORY view records this information:

- A data source: `base_table`
- Create a table from the data source (i.e. CTAS):

  Copy code

  ```
  create table table_1 as select * from base_table;
  ```

In this example, Snowflake returns:

- `base_table` in the `base_objects_accessed` and `direct_objects_accessed` columns because the table was accessed directly
  and is the source of the data.
- `table_1` in the `objects_modified` column with the columns that were written to when creating the table.

### Supported operations

For a complete description of the read and write operations the ACCESS\_HISTORY view supports, see the usage notes sections in the
[ACCESS\_HISTORY view](/sql-reference/account-usage/access_history).

### Multiple statements in a single request

Snowflake supports executing multiple statements simultaneously as a single request. How you track the request in the access history depends
on whether it was executed in Snowsight or programmatically.

- When you use Snowsight to execute multiple statements, it runs the queries one at a time and returns the
  `query_id` of the last executed query. You can find all executed statements and their return values in the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.
- Features like the Snowflake Python connector or the Snowflake SQL API combine multiple SQL statements into a single request and return a
  single `query_id` for all of the statements. This number is actually a parent query id for all of the individual
  statements. To return the `query_id` of each statement that comprised the request, you must query the ACCESS\_HISTORY view using the
  `parent_query_id`. For example, if the request returned `query_id = 6789`, then you can return the query ids of the individual
  statements by executing the following:

  Copy code

  ```
  SELECT query_id, parent_query_id, direct_objects_accessed
  FROM snowflake.account_usage.access_history
  WHERE parent_query_id = 6789;
  ```

### Benefits

Access history in Snowflake provides the following benefits pertaining to read and write operations:

Data discovery:
:   Discover unused data to determine whether to archive or delete the data.

Track how sensitive data moves:
:   Track data movement from an external cloud storage location (e.g. Amazon S3 bucket) to the target Snowflake table, and vice versa.

    Track internal data movement from a Snowflake table to a different Snowflake table.

    After tracing the movement of sensitive data, apply policies ([masking](/user-guide/security-column-intro) and
    [row access](/user-guide/security-row-intro)) to protect data, update
    [access control settings](/user-guide/security-access-control-overview) to further regulate access to the stage and table, and set
    [tags](/user-guide/object-tagging/introduction) to ensure stages, tables, and columns with sensitive data can be tracked for compliance
    requirements.

Data validation:
:   The accuracy and integrity of reports, dashboards, and data visualization products such as charts and graphs are validated since the
    data can be traced to its original source.

    Data stewards can also notify users prior to dropping or altering a given table or view.

Compliance auditing:
:   Identify the Snowflake user who performed a write operation on a table or stage and when the write operation occurred to meet compliance
    regulations, such as [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).

Enhance overall data governance:
:   The ACCESS\_HISTORY view provides a unified picture of what data was accessed, when the data access took place, and how the accessed data
    moved from the data source object to the data target object.

## Access history for Horizon Iceberg REST Catalog operations

The ACCESS\_HISTORY view also records successful operations that external query engines
(such as Spark, Trino, DuckDB, or PyIceberg) perform against Snowflake-managed
Apache Iceberg™ tables through the Horizon Iceberg REST Catalog (IRC) APIs. These records
complement the entries that ACCESS\_HISTORY generates for SQL statements executed inside
Snowflake, so you can audit reads, DML, and DDL that originate from external engines
alongside your Snowflake-side activity.

You can identify IRC-sourced records by filtering on `event_source = 'horizon_irc'`,
and inspect the `additional_properties` column to see the Iceberg operation type
(for example, `LoadTable`, `CreateTable`, or `UpdateTable`).

For details, see
[Horizon Iceberg REST Catalog operations in ACCESS\_HISTORY](/user-guide/tables-iceberg-access-using-external-query-engine-snowflake-horizon-access-history).

## Column lineage

Column lineage (i.e. access history for columns) extends the Account Usage ACCESS\_HISTORY view to specify how data flows from the source
column to the target column in a write operation. Snowflake tracks the data from the source columns through all subsequent table objects
that reference data from the source columns (e.g. INSERT, MERGE, CTAS) provided that objects in the lineage chain are not dropped.
Snowflake makes column lineage accessible by enhancing the `objects_modified` column in the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.

Column lineage provides the following benefits:

Protect Derived Objects:
:   Data stewards can easily [tag](/user-guide/object-tagging/introduction) sensitive source columns without having to do additional work after
    creating derived objects (e.g. CTAS). Subsequently, the data steward can protect tables containing sensitive columns with a
    [row access policy](/user-guide/security-row-intro) or protect the sensitive columns themselves with either a
    [masking policy](/user-guide/security-column-intro) or a
    [tag-based masking policy](/user-guide/tag-based-masking-policies).

Sensitive Column Copy Frequency:
:   Data privacy officers can quickly determine the object count (e.g. 1 table, 2 views) of a column containing sensitive data. By knowing
    how many times a column with sensitive data appears in a table object, data privacy officers can prove how they satisfy regulatory
    compliance standards (e.g. to meet General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standards in the European Union).

Root Cause Analysis:
:   Column lineage provides a mechanism to trace the data to its source, which can help to pinpoint points of failure resulting from
    poor data quality and reduce the number of columns to analyze during the troubleshooting process.

For additional details about column lineage, see:

- [Column lineage](#label-access-history-example-col-lineage) (in this topic)

## Masking and row access policy references

The POLICY\_REFERENCED column specifies the object that has a row access policy set on a table or a masking policy set on a column,
including any intermediate objects that are protected by either a row access policy or a masking policy. Snowflake records the policy that
is enforced on the table or column.

Consider these objects:

`t1` » `v1` » `v2`

Where:

- `t1` is a base table.
- `v1` is a view built from the base table.
- `v2` is a view built from `v1`.

If the user queries `v2`, the `policies_referenced` column records either the row access policy that protects `v2`, each masking
policy that protects the columns in `v2`, or both kinds of policy as applicable. Additionally, this column records any masking or row
access policies that protect `t1` and `v1`.

These records can help data governors understand how their policy-protected objects are accessed.

The `policies_referenced` column provides additional benefits to the ACCESS\_HISTORY view:

- Identify the policy-protected objects a user accesses in a given query.
- Simplify the policy audit process.

  Querying the ACCESS\_HISTORY view eliminates the need for complex joins on other Account Usage views
  (e.g. [POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/account-usage/policy_references) and
  [QUERY\_HISTORY](/sql-reference/account-usage/query_history)), to obtain information about the protected objects and protected
  columns a user accesses.

## Account-level vs. Organization-level access history

Administrators monitor access history at the account-level by querying the
[ACCESS\_HISTORY view](/sql-reference/account-usage/access_history) in the account’s ACCOUNT\_USAGE schema. There
is no additional cost associated with the ACCOUNT\_USAGE.ACCESS\_HISTORY view.

The ACCESS\_HISTORY view in the ORGANIZATION\_USAGE schema gathers the access history of all of the accounts in an organization into a single
view to provide an organization-level access history. This ORGANIZATION\_USAGE.ACCESS\_HISTORY view is only found in the
[organization account](/user-guide/organization-accounts).

Organization-level access history in the ORGANIZATION\_USAGE schema differs from access history in the ACCOUNT\_USAGE schema in the
following ways:

Additional columns:
:   The ORGANIZATION\_USAGE.ACCESS\_HISTORY view in the organization account contains additional columns that provide insights related to
    [organizational listings](/user-guide/collaboration/listings/organizational/org-listing-about). These columns can be used to determine which of
    the data products attached to an organization listing were accessed by a consumer’s query, and whether those data products are protected
    by a policy such as a masking policy. For more information, see [Organizational listing governance](/user-guide/collaboration/listings/organizational/org-listing-governance).

Additional cost:
:   The ORGANIZATION\_USAGE.ACCESS\_HISTORY view in the organization account is a premium view that incurs the following costs:

    - Compute costs associated with the serverless tasks that populate the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.
    - Storage costs associated with storing the data in the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.

    For more information about these costs, see [Costs associated with premium views](/user-guide/organization-accounts-premium-views#label-org-account-views-cost).

## Supported Objects

Use the following table to determine whether the ACCESS\_HISTORY view contains a record when a SQL statement involves a specific type of object. SQL statements include the following:

- Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements. For example, statements used to insert data into a table.
- Data Query Language (DQL) statements. For example, statements that use a SELECT statement to project data.
- Data Definition Language (DDL) statements. For example, statements that create or alter a Snowflake object.

| Object | DML | DQL | DDL | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DATABASE | n/a | n/a | ✔ |  |
| DYNAMIC TABLE | Partial | ✔ | ✔ | Support for DML is only for the `ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE ... REFRESH` command. |
| EXTERNAL TABLE | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |  |
| AGENT | n/a | n/a | ✔ | DDL for Cortex agent objects (for example CREATE AGENT, ALTER AGENT, and DROP AGENT). |
| FUNCTION | n/a | ✔ | ✔ | Support for DQL is limited to a function that appears in a SELECT statement. |
| ICEBERG TABLE | Partial | ✔ | ✔ | Full support (DML, DQL, DDL) for Snowflake-managed Apache Iceberg™ tables. Support for DQL and DDL only for externally managed Apache Iceberg™ tables. |

| MCP SERVER | n/a | n/a | ✔ | DDL for MCP servers (for example CREATE MCP SERVER, ALTER MCP SERVER, and DROP MCP SERVER). |
| POLICY | n/a | ✔ | ✔ | Support for DDL shows when a policy is applied to an object and when policy metadata is queried via SHOW and DESCRIBE commands. Support for DQL shows the policies under enforcement when a query is run. |
| POSTGRES INSTANCE | n/a | n/a | ✔ | DDL for Postgres instances (for example CREATE POSTGRES INSTANCE, ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE, and DROP POSTGRES INSTANCE). |
| PROCEDURE | n/a | ✔ | ✔ | A procedure can have multiple SQL statements with each statement generating a separate record. |
| ROLE | n/a | n/a | ✔ |  |

## Querying the ACCESS\_HISTORY View

The following sections provide example queries for the ACCESS\_HISTORY view.

Note that some of the example queries filter on the `query_start_time` column to increase query performance. Another option to
increase performance is to query over narrower time ranges.

## Access history examples

### Read queries

The subsections below detail how to query the ACCESS\_HISTORY view for read operations for the following use cases:

- Obtain the access history for a specific user.
- Facilitate compliance audits for sensitive data access in the last 30 days, based on `object_id` (e.g. a table id), to answer the
  following questions:
  - Who accessed the data?
  - When was the data accessed?
  - What columns were accessed?

#### Return the user access history

Return the user access history, ordered by user and query start time, starting from the most recent access.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> SELECT user_name
>        , query_id
>        , query_start_time
>        , direct_objects_accessed
>        , base_objects_accessed
> FROM access_history
> ORDER BY 1, 3 desc
> ;
> ```

#### Facilitate compliance audits

The following examples help to facilitate compliance audits:

- Add the `object_id` value to determine who accessed a sensitive table in the last 30 days:

  Copy code

  ```
  SELECT distinct user_name
  FROM access_history
    , lateral flatten(base_objects_accessed) f1
  WHERE f1.value:"objectId"::int=<fill_in_object_id>
  AND f1.value:"objectDomain"::string='Table'
  AND query_start_time >= dateadd('day', -30, current_timestamp())
  ;
  ```
- Using the `object_id` value of `32998411400350`, determine when the access occurred in the last 30 days:

  Copy code

  ```
  SELECT query_id
      , query_start_time
  FROM access_history
    , lateral flatten(base_objects_accessed) f1
  WHERE f1.value:"objectId"::int=32998411400350
  AND f1.value:"objectDomain"::string='Table'
  AND query_start_time >= dateadd('day', -30, current_timestamp())
  ;
  ```
- Using the `object_id` value of `32998411400350`, determine which columns were accessed in the last 30 days:

  Copy code

  ```
  SELECT distinct f4.value AS column_name
  FROM access_history
    , lateral flatten(base_objects_accessed) f1
    , lateral flatten(f1.value) f2
    , lateral flatten(f2.value) f3
    , lateral flatten(f3.value) f4
  WHERE f1.value:"objectId"::int=32998411400350
  AND f1.value:"objectDomain"::string='Table'
  AND f4.key='columnName'
  ;
  ```

### Write operations

The subsections below detail how to query the ACCESS\_HISTORY view for write operations for the following use cases:

- Load data from a stage to a table.
- Unload data from a table to a stage.
- Use the PUT command to upload a local file to a stage.
- Use the GET command to retrieve data files from a stage to a local directory.
- Tracking sensitive stage data movement.

#### Load data from a stage to a table

Load a set of values from a data file in external cloud storage into columns in a target table.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> copy into table1(col1, col2)
> from (select t.$1, t.$2 from @mystage1/data1.csv.gz);
> ```

The `direct_objects_accessed` and `base_objects_accessed` column specify that an external named stage was accessed:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectDomain": STAGE
>   "objectName": "mystage1",
>   "objectId": 1,
>   "stageKind": "External Named"
> }
> ```

The `objects_modified` column specifies that data was written to two columns of the table:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "columns": [
>      {
>        "columnName": "col1",
>        "columnId": 1
>      },
>      {
>        "columnName": "col2",
>        "columnId": 2
>      }
>   ],
>   "objectId": 1,
>   "objectName": "TEST_DB.TEST_SCHEMA.TABLE1",
>   "objectDomain": TABLE
> }
> ```

#### Unload data from a table to a stage

Unload a set of values from a Snowflake table into cloud storage.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> copy into @mystage1/data1.csv
> from table1;
> ```

The `direct_objects_accessed` and `base_objects_accessed` columns specify the table columns that were
accessed:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectDomain": TABLE
>   "objectName": "TEST_DB.TEST_SCHEMA.TABLE1",
>   "objectId": 123,
>   "columns": [
>      {
>        "columnName": "col1",
>        "columnId": 1
>      },
>      {
>        "columnName": "col2",
>        "columnId": 2
>      }
>   ]
> }
> ```

The `objects_modified` column specifies the stage to which the accessed data was written:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectId": 1,
>   "objectName": "mystage1",
>   "objectDomain": STAGE,
>   "stageKind": "External Named"
> }
> ```

#### Use the PUT Command to upload a local file to a stage

Copy a data file to an internal (i.e. Snowflake) stage.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> put file:///tmp/data/mydata.csv @my_int_stage;
> ```

The `direct_objects_accessed` and `base_objects_accessed` columns specify the local path to the file that was
accessed:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "location": "file:///tmp/data/mydata.csv"
> }
> ```

The `objects_modified` column specifies the stage where the accessed data was written:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectId": 1,
>   "objectName": "my_int_stage",
>   "objectDomain": STAGE,
>   "stageKind": "Internal Named"
> }
> ```

#### Use the GET command to retrieve data files from a stage to a local directory

Retrieve a data file from an internal stage to a directory on the local machine.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> get @%mytable file:///tmp/data/;
> ```

The `direct_objects_accessed` and `base_objects_accessed` columns specify the stage and local directory that were
accessed:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectDomain": Stage
>   "objectName": "mytable",
>   "objectId": 1,
>   "stageKind": "Table"
> }
> ```

The `objects_modified` column specifies the directory to which the accessed data was written:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "location": "file:///tmp/data/"
> }
> ```

#### Tracking Sensitive stage data movement

Track sensitive stage data as it moves through a series of queries executed in chronological order.

Execute the following queries. Note that five of the statements access stage data. Therefore, when you query the ACCESS\_HISTORY view for
stage access, the result set should include five rows.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> use test_db.test_schema;
> create or replace table T1(content variant);
> insert into T1(content) select parse_json('{"name": "A", "id":1}');
>
> -- T1 -> T6
> insert into T6 select * from T1;
>
> -- S1 -> T1
> copy into T1 from @S1;
>
> -- T1 -> T2
> create table T2 as select content:"name" as name, content:"id" as id from T1;
>
> -- T1 -> S2
> copy into @S2 from T1;
>
> -- S1 -> T3
> create or replace table T3(customer_info variant);
> copy into T3 from @S1;
>
> -- T1 -> T4
> create or replace table T4(name string, id string, address string);
> insert into T4(name, id) select content:"name", content:"id" from T1;
>
> -- T6 -> T7
> create table T7 as select * from T6;
> ```
>
> Where:
>
> - `T1`, `T2` … `T7` specify the names of tables.
> - `S1` and `S2` specify the names of stages.

Query the access history to determine the access to stage `S1`.

### Column lineage

The following example queries the ACCESS\_HISTORY view and uses the [FLATTEN](/sql-reference/functions/flatten) function to flatten the
`objects_modified` column.

As a representative example, execute the following SQL query in your Snowflake account to produce the table below, where the numbered
comments indicate the following:

- `// 1`: Get the mapping between the `directSources` field and the target column.
- `// 2`: Get the mapping between the `baseSources` field and the target column.

Copy code

```
// 1

select
  directSources.value: "objectId" as source_object_id,
  directSources.value: "objectName" as source_object_name,
  directSources.value: "columnName" as source_column_name,
  'DIRECT' as source_column_type,
  om.value: "objectName" as target_object_name,
  columns_modified.value: "columnName" as target_column_name
from
  (
    select
      *
    from
      snowflake.account_usage.access_history
  ) t,
  lateral flatten(input => t.OBJECTS_MODIFIED) om,
  lateral flatten(input => om.value: "columns", outer => true) columns_modified,
  lateral flatten(
    input => columns_modified.value: "directSources",
    outer => true
  ) directSources

union

// 2

select
  baseSources.value: "objectId" as source_object_id,
  baseSources.value: "objectName" as source_object_name,
  baseSources.value: "columnName" as source_column_name,
  'BASE' as source_column_type,
  om.value: "objectName" as target_object_name,
  columns_modified.value: "columnName" as target_column_name
from
  (
    select
      *
    from
      snowflake.account_usage.access_history
  ) t,
  lateral flatten(input => t.OBJECTS_MODIFIED) om,
  lateral flatten(input => om.value: "columns", outer => true) columns_modified,
  lateral flatten(
    input => columns_modified.value: "baseSources",
    outer => true
  ) baseSources
;
```

Returns:

> | SOURCE\_OBJECT\_ID | SOURCE\_OBJECT\_NAME | SOURCE\_COLUMN\_NAME | SOURCE\_COLUMN\_TYPE | TARGET\_OBJECT\_NAME | TARGET\_COLUMN\_NAME |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | 1 | D.S.T0 | NAME | BASE | D.S.T1 | NAME |
> | 2 | D.S.V1 | NAME | DIRECT | D.S.T1 | NAME |

### Track row access policy references

Return a row for each instance when a row access policy is set on a table, view, or materialized view without duplicates:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> use role accountadmin;
> select distinct
>     obj_policy.value:"policyName"::VARCHAR as policy_name
> from snowflake.account_usage.access_history as ah
>     , lateral flatten(ah.policies_referenced) as obj
>     , lateral flatten(obj.value:"policies") as obj_policy
> ;
> ```

### Track masking policy references

Return a row for each instance when a masking policy protects a column without duplicates. Note that additional flattening is necessary
because the `policies_referenced` column specifies the masking policy on a column one level deeper than the row access policy on a
table:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> use role accountadmin;
> select distinct
>     policies.value:"policyName"::VARCHAR as policy_name
> from snowflake.account_usage.access_history as ah
>     , lateral flatten(ah.policies_referenced) as obj
>     , lateral flatten(obj.value:"columns") as columns
>     , lateral flatten(columns.value:"policies") as policies
> ;
> ```

### Track the enforced policy in a query

Return the time when the policy was updated (POLICY\_CHANGED\_TIME) and the policy conditions (POLICY\_BODY) for a given query in a given time
frame.

Prior to using this query, update the WHERE clause input values:

Copy code

```
where query_start_time > '2023-07-07' and
   query_start_time < '2023-07-08' and
   query_id = '01ad7987-0606-6e2c-0001-dd20f12a9777')
```

Where:

`query_start_time > '2023-07-07'`
:   Specifies the beginning timestamp.

`query_start_time < '2023-07-08'`
:   Specifies the end timestamp.

`query_id = '01ad7987-0606-6e2c-0001-dd20f12a9777'`
:   Specifies the query identifier in the Account Usage ACCESS\_HISTORY view.

Run the query:

Copy code

```
SELECT *
from(
  select j1.*,j2.QUERY_START_TIME as POLICY_CHANGED_TIME, POLICY_BODY
from
(
  select distinct t1.*,
      t4.value:"policyId"::number as PID
  from (select *
      from SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY
      where query_start_time > '2023-07-07' and
         query_start_time < '2023-07-08' and
         query_id = '01ad7987-0606-6e2c-0001-dd20f12a9777') as t1, //
  lateral flatten (input => t1.POLICIES_REFERENCED,OUTER => TRUE) t2,
  lateral flatten (input => t2.value:"columns", OUTER => TRUE) t3,
  lateral flatten (input => t3.value:"policies",OUTER => TRUE) t4
) as j1
left join
(
  select OBJECT_MODIFIED_BY_DDL:"objectId"::number as PID,
      QUERY_START_TIME,
      OBJECT_MODIFIED_BY_DDL:"properties"."policyBody"."value" as POLICY_BODY
      from SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY
      where OBJECT_MODIFIED_BY_DDL is not null and
      (OBJECT_MODIFIED_BY_DDL:"objectDomain" ilike '%masking%' or OBJECT_MODIFIED_BY_DDL:"objectDomain" ilike '%row%')
) as j2
On j1.POLICIES_REFERENCED is not null and j1.pid = j2.pid and j1.QUERY_START_TIME>j2.QUERY_START_TIME) as j3
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY query_id,pid ORDER BY policy_changed_time DESC) = 1;
```

### UDFs

These UDF examples show how the Account Usage ACCESS\_HISTORY view records:

- [Calling](#label-access-history-example-udf-call) a UDF named `get_product`.
- [Insert](#label-access-history-example-udf-insert) the product of calling the `get_product` function into a table named
  `mydb.tables.t1`.
- [Shared](#label-access-history-example-udf-shared) UDFs.

#### Call a UDF

Consider the following SQL UDF that calculates the product of two numbers and assume it is stored in the schema named `mydb.udfs`:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> CREATE FUNCTION MYDB.UDFS.GET_PRODUCT(num1 number, num2 number)
> RETURNS number
> AS
> $$
>     NUM1 * NUM2
> $$
> ;
> ```

[Calling](/sql-reference/sql/call) `get_product` directly results in recording the UDF details in the
`direct_objects_accessed` column:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> [
>   {
>     "objectDomain": "FUNCTION",
>     "objectName": "MYDB.UDFS.GET_PRODUCT",
>     "objectId": "2",
>     "argumentSignature": "(NUM1 NUMBER, NUM2 NUMBER)",
>     "dataType": "NUMBER(38,0)"
>   }
> ]
> ```

This example is analogous to [calling a stored procedure](#label-access-history-example-call-stored-procedure) (in this topic).

#### UDF with INSERT DML

Consider the following [INSERT](/sql-reference/sql/insert) statement to update the columns named 1 and 2 in the table named `mydb.tables.t1`:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> insert into t1(product)
> select get_product(c1, c2) from mydb.tables.t1;
> ```

The ACCESS\_HISTORY view records the `get_product` function in the:

- `direct_objects_accessed` column because the function is explicitly named in the SQL statement, and
- `objects_modified` column in the `directSources` array because the function is the source of the values that are inserted into
  the columns.

Similarly, the table `t1` is recorded in these same columns:

> | `direct_objects_accessed` | `objects_modified` |
> | --- | --- |
> | Copy code  ``` [   {     "objectDomain": "FUNCTION",     "objectName": "MYDB.UDFS.GET_PRODUCT",     "objectId": "2",     "argumentSignature": "(NUM1 NUMBER, NUM2 NUMBER)",     "dataType": "NUMBER(38,0)"   },   {     "objectDomain": "TABLE",     "objectName": "MYDB.TABLES.T1",     "objectId": 1,     "columns":     [       {         "columnName": "c1",         "columnId": 1       },       {         "columnName": "c2",         "columnId": 2       }     ]   } ] ``` | Copy code  ```  [    {      "objectDomain": "TABLE",      "objectName": "MYDB.TABLES.T1",      "objectId": 2,      "columns":      [        {          "columnId": "product",          "columnName": "201",          "directSourceColumns":          [            {              "objectDomain": "Table",              "objectName": "MYDB.TABLES.T1",              "objectId": "1",              "columnName": "c1"            },            {              "objectDomain": "Table",              "objectName": "MYDB.TABLES.T1",              "objectId": "1",              "columnName": "c2"            },            {              "objectDomain": "FUNCTION",              "objectName": "MYDB.UDFS.GET_PRODUCT",              "objectId": "2",              "argumentSignature": "(NUM1 NUMBER, NUM2 NUMBER)",              "dataType": "NUMBER(38,0)"            }          ],          "baseSourceColumns":[]        }      ]    } ] ``` |

#### Shared UDFs

Shared UDFs can be referenced directly or indirectly:

- A direct reference is the same as [calling the UDF explicitly](#label-access-history-example-udf-call) (in this topic) but results
  in the UDF being recorded in both the `base_objects_accessed` and `direct_objects_accessed` columns.
- An example of an indirect reference is calling the UDF to create a view:

  Copy code

  ```
  create view v as
  select get_product(c1, c2) as vc from t;
  ```

  The `base_objects_accessed` column records the UDF and the table.

  The `direct_objects_accessed` column records the view.

### Tracking objects modified by a DDL operation

#### Create a tag with ALLOWED\_VALUES

Create the tag:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> create tag governance.tags.pii allowed_values 'sensitive','public';
> ```

Column value:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectDomain": "TAG",
>   "objectName": "governance.tags.pii",
>   "objectId": "1",
>   "operationType": "CREATE",
>   "properties": {
>     "allowedValues": {
>       "sensitive": {
>         "subOperationType": "ADD"
>       },
>       "public": {
>         "subOperationType": "ADD"
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

Note

If you do not specify allowed values when creating the tag, the `properties` field is an empty array (i.e. `{}`).

#### Create a table with a tag and masking policy

Create the table with a masking policy on the column, a tag on the column, and a tag on the table:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> create or replace table hr.data.user_info(
>   email string
>     with masking policy governance.policies.email_mask
>     with tag (governance.tags.pii = 'sensitive')
>   )
> with tag (governance.tags.pii = 'sensitive');
> ```

Column value:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectDomain": "TABLE",
>   "objectName": "hr.data.user_info",
>   "objectId": "1",
>   "operationType": "CREATE",
>   "properties": {
>     "tags": {
>       "governance.tags.pii": {
>         "subOperationType": "ADD",
>         "objectId": {
>           "value": "1"
>         },
>         "tagValue": {
>           "value": "sensitive"
>         }
>       }
>     },
>     "columns": {
>       "email": {
>         objectId: {
>           "value": 1
>         },
>         "subOperationType": "ADD",

#### Set a masking policy on a tag

Set a masking policy on the tag (i.e. [tag-based masking](/user-guide/tag-based-masking-policies)):

> Copy code
>
> ```
> alter tag governance.tags.pii set masking policy governance.policies.email_mask;
> ```

Column value:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectDomain": "TAG",
>   "objectName": "governance.tags.pii",
>   "objectId": "1",
>   "operationType": "ALTER",
>   "properties": {
>     "maskingPolicies": {
>       "governance.policies.email_mask": {
>         "subOperationType": "ADD",
>         "objectId": {
>           "value": 2
>         }
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

#### Swap a table

Swap the table named `t2` with the table named `t3`:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> alter table governance.tables.t2 swap with governance.tables.t3;
> ```

Note the two different records in the view.

Record 1:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectDomain": "Table",
>   "objectId": 0,
>   "objectName": "GOVERNANCE.TABLES.T2",
>   "operationType": "ALTER",
>   "properties": {
>     "swapTargetDomain": {
>       "value": "Table"
>     },
>     "swapTargetId": {
>       "value": 0
>     },
>     "swapTargetName": {
>       "value": "GOVERNANCE.TABLES.T3"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

Record 2:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectDomain": "Table",
>   "objectId": 0,
>   "objectName": "GOVERNANCE.TABLES.T3",
>   "operationType": "ALTER",
>   "properties": {
>     "swapTargetDomain": {
>       "value": "Table"
>     },
>     "swapTargetId": {
>       "value": 0
>     },
>     "swapTargetName": {
>       "value": "GOVERNANCE.TABLES.T2"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

#### Drop a masking policy

Drop the masking policy:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> drop masking policy governance.policies.email_mask;
> ```

Column value:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> {
>   "objectDomain" : "MASKING_POLICY",
>   "objectName": "governance.policies.email_mask",
>   "objectId" : "1",
>   "operationType": "DROP",
>   "properties" : {}
> }
> ```
>
> Note
>
> The column value is representative and applies to a DROP operation on a tag and row access policy.
>
> The `properties` field is an empty array and does not provide any information on the policy prior to the DROP operation.

#### Track tag references on a column

Query the `object_modified_by_ddl` column to monitor how a tag is set on a column.

As the table administrator, set a tag on a column, unset the tag, and update the tag with a different string value:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> alter table hr.tables.empl_info
>   alter column email set tag governance.tags.test_tag = 'test';
>
> alter table hr.tables.empl_info
>   alter column email unset tag governance.tags.test_tag;
>
> alter table hr.tables.empl_info
>   alter column email set tag governance.tags.data_category = 'sensitive';
> ```

As the data engineer, change the tag value:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> alter table hr.tables.empl_info
>   alter column email set tag governance.tags.data_category = 'public';
> ```

Query the ACCESS\_HISTORY view to monitor the changes:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> select
>   query_start_time,
>   user_name,
>   object_modified_by_ddl:"objectName"::string as table_name,
>   'EMAIL' as column_name,
>   tag_history.value:"subOperationType"::string as operation,
>   tag_history.key as tag_name,
>   nvl((tag_history.value:"tagValue"."value")::string, '') as value
> from
>   TEST_DB.ACCOUNT_USAGE.access_history ah,
>   lateral flatten(input => ah.OBJECT_MODIFIED_BY_DDL:"properties"."columns"."EMAIL"."tags") tag_history
> where true
>   and object_modified_by_ddl:"objectDomain" = 'Table'
>   and object_modified_by_ddl:"objectName" = 'TEST_DB.TEST_SH.T'
> order by query_start_time asc;
> ```

Returns:

### Call a stored procedure

Consider the following stored procedure and assume it is stored in the schema named `mydb.procedures`:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> create or replace procedure get_id_value(name string)
> returns string not null
> language javascript
> as
> $$
>   var my_sql_command = "select id from A where name = '" + NAME + "'";
>   var statement = snowflake.createStatement( {sqlText: my_sql_command} );
>   var result = statement.execute();
>   result.next();
>   return result.getColumnValue(1);
> $$
> ;
> ```

[Calling](/sql-reference/sql/call) `my_procedure` directly results in recording the procedure details in both the
`direct_objects_accessed` and `base_objects_accessed` columns as follows:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> [
>   {
>     "objectDomain": "PROCEDURE",
>     "objectName": "MYDB.PROCEDURES.GET_ID_VALUE",
>     "argumentSignature": "(NAME STRING)",
>     "dataType": "STRING"
>   }
> ]
> ```

This example is analogous to [calling a UDF](#label-access-history-example-udf-call) (in this topic).

### Ancestor queries with stored procedures

You can use the `parent_query_id` and `root_query_id` columns to understand how stored procedure calls relate to each other.

Suppose that you have three different stored procedure statements and you run them in the following order:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE myproc_child()
> RETURNS INTEGER
> LANGUAGE SQL
> AS
> $$
>   BEGIN
>   SELECT * FROM mydb.mysch.mytable;
>   RETURN 1;
>   END
> $$;
>
> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE myproc_parent()
> RETURNS INTEGER
> LANGUAGE SQL
> AS
> $$
>   BEGIN
>   CALL myproc_child();
>   RETURN 1;
>   END
> $$;
>
> CALL myproc_parent();
> ```

A query on the ACCESS\_HISTORY view records the information as follows:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> SELECT
>   query_id,
>   parent_query_id,
>   root_query_id,
>   direct_objects_accessed
> FROM
>   SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY;
> ```
>
> ```
> +----------+-----------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+
> | QUERY_ID | PARENT_QUERY_ID | ROOT_QUERY_ID | DIRECT_OBJECTS_ACCESSED           |
> +----------+-----------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+
> |  1       | NULL            | NULL          | [{"objectName": "myproc_parent"}] |
> |  2       | 1               | 1             | [{"objectName": "myproc_child"}]  |
> |  3       | 2               | 1             | [{"objectName": "mytable"}]       |
> +----------+-----------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+
> ```

- The first row corresponds to calling the second procedure named `myproc_parent` as shown in the `direct_objects_accessed`
  column.

  The `parent_query_id` and `root_query_id` columns return NULL because you called this stored procedure directly.
- The second row corresponds to the query that calls the first procedure named `myproc_child` as shown in the
  `direct_objects_accessed column`.

  The `parent_query_id` and `root_query_id` columns return the same query ID because the query calling `myproc_child` was
  initiated by the query calling `myproc_parent`, which you called directly.
- The third row corresponds to the query that accessed the table named `mytable` in the `myproc_child` procedure as shown in
  the `direct_objects_accessed` column.

  The `parent_query_id` column returns the query ID of the query that accessed `mytable`, which corresponds to calling
  `myproc_child`. That stored procedure was initiated by the query calling `myproc_parent`, which is shown in the
  `root_query_id` column.

### Sequence

Consider the following SQL statement that creates a sequence:

Copy code

```
CREATE SEQUENCE SEQ
  START = 2
  INCREMENT = 7
  COMMENT = 'Comment on sequence';
```

Creating this sequence results in the following entry in the access history:

Copy code

```
{
  "objectDomain": "Sequence",
  "objectId": 1,
  "objectName": "TEST_DB.TEST_SCHEMA.SEQ",
  "operationType": "CREATE",
  "properties": {
    "start": {
      "value": "2"
    },
    "increment": {
        "value": "7"
    },
    "comment": {
          "value": "Comment on Sequence"
    }
  }
}
```

### Join

A join in a query shows up in the access history as a `joinObject` in the `direct_accessed_objects` column. The `joinObject` does
not appear in other columns because access history only tracks joins that are explicitly mentioned in the query.

For example, consider the following query that joins table `t1` with table `t2`:

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v1 (vc1, vc2) AS
  SELECT
    t1.c1 AS vc1,
    t2.c2 AS vc2
  FROM t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2
    ON t1.c2 = t2.c1;
```

Executing this query results in the following appearing for the `t1` object in the `direct_accessed_objects` column:

Copy code

```
{
  "columns": [
    {
      "columnId": 0,
      "columnName": "C1"
    },
    {
      "columnId": 0,
      "columnName": "C2"
    }
  ],
  "joinObjects": [
    {
      "joinType": "LEFT_OUTER_JOIN",
      "node": {
        "objectDomain": "Table",
        "objectId": 0,
        "objectName": "DB1.SCH.T2"
      }
    }
  ],
  "objectDomain": "Table",
  "objectId": 0,
  "objectName": "DB1.SCH.T1"
}
```

Note

In this example, access history wouldn’t contain a `joinObject` for the `t2` object because it would be redundant to the information
provided by the `joinObject` for table `t1`.
