# Troubleshooting bulk data loads

This topic describes a methodical approach to troubleshooting issues with bulk data loads.

## Data load failures

### Step 1: Viewing the COPY history for the table

Query the load activity history for a table. For information, see [COPY\_HISTORY](/sql-reference/functions/copy_history). The `STATUS` column indicates whether a particular set of files was loaded, partially loaded, or failed to load. The `FIRST_ERROR_MESSAGE` column provides a reason when an attempt partially loaded or failed.

Note that if a set of files has multiple issues, the `FIRST_ERROR_MESSAGE` column only indicates the first error encountered. To view all errors in the files, see [Step 2: Validating the Data Load](#step-2-validating-the-data-load) for instructions.

### Step 2: Validating the data load

The VALIDATION\_MODE copy option instructs a COPY statement to validate the data to be loaded and return results based on the validation option specified. No data is loaded when this copy option is specified. For more information about the copy option, see [COPY INTO <table>](/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table).

Execute a COPY statement with the VALIDATION\_MODE copy option set to `RETURN_ALL_ERRORS`. In the statement, reference the set of files you had attempted to load.

The following example validates a set of files that contain errors. To facilitate analysis of the errors, a [COPY INTO <location>](/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location) statement then unloads the problematic records into a text file so they could be analyzed and fixed in the original data files. The statement queries the [RESULT\_SCAN](/sql-reference/functions/result_scan) table function to retrieve the records. Note that the statements in this section must be run in succession in order to retrieve the applicable records using the [LAST\_QUERY\_ID](/sql-reference/functions/last_query_id) function.

Copy code

```
COPY INTO mytable
  FROM @mystage/myfile.csv.gz
  VALIDATION_MODE=RETURN_ALL_ERRORS;

SET qid=last_query_id();

COPY INTO @mystage/errors/load_errors.txt FROM (SELECT rejected_record FROM TABLE(result_scan($qid)));
```

## Other issues

### Error: Integration `{0}` associated with the stage `{1}` cannot be found

Copy code

```
003139=SQL compilation error:\nIntegration ''{0}'' associated with the stage ''{1}'' cannot be found.
```

This error can occur when the association between the external stage and the storage
integration linked to the stage has been broken. This happens when the storage integration
object has been recreated (using
[CREATE OR REPLACE STORAGE INTEGRATION](/sql-reference/sql/create-storage-integration)).
A stage links to a storage integration using a hidden ID rather than the name of the storage
integration. Behind the scenes, the CREATE OR REPLACE syntax drops the object and recreates
it with a different hidden ID.

If you must recreate a storage integration after it has been linked to one or more stages,
you must reestablish the association between each stage and the storage integration by
executing [ALTER STAGE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-stage)
`stage_name` SET STORAGE\_INTEGRATION = `storage_integration_name`, where:

- `stage_name` is the name of the stage.
- `storage_integration_name` is the name of the storage integration.

### Load times inserted using CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP earlier than LOAD\_TIME values in COPY\_HISTORY view

Table designers may add a timestamp column that inserts the current timestamp as the default value as records are loaded into a table. The intent is to capture the time when each record was loaded into the table; however, the timestamps are earlier than the LOAD\_TIME column values returned by the [COPY\_HISTORY function](/sql-reference/functions/copy_history) (Information Schema) or the [COPY\_HISTORY view](/sql-reference/account-usage/copy_history) (Account Usage). The reason is, [CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP](/sql-reference/functions/current_timestamp) is evaluated when the load operation is compiled in cloud services rather than when the record is inserted into the table (i.e. when the transaction for the load operation is committed).

It is recommended to include and query [METADATA$START\_SCAN\_TIME](/user-guide/querying-metadata) instead, which provides a more accurate representation of record loading.
