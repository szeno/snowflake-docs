# Understanding How Snowflake Can Eliminate Redundant Joins

In some cases, a join on a key column can refer to tables that are not needed for the join. If your tables have key columns and
you are using and enforcing the UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, and FOREIGN KEY constraints, Snowflake can improve query performance by
eliminating unnecessary joins on key columns.

These optimizations are performed only if you use the RELY constraint property to indicate that the data in your tables complies
with the constraints around primary keys and foreign keys.

## Setting the RELY Constraint Property to Eliminate Unnecessary Joins

Snowflake only performs this optimization on joins if you indicate that the data in your tables comply with the UNIQUE, PRIMARY
KEY, and FOREIGN KEY constraints.

As mentioned in [Supported constraint types](/sql-reference/constraints-overview#label-constraints-supported-types), Snowflake does not enforce UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, and FOREIGN KEY
constraints on standard tables, but does enforce them on [hybrid tables](/user-guide/tables-hybrid). For standard tables, you are
responsible for enforcing constraints on the data.

If you have ensured that the data complies with these constraints and you want Snowflake to eliminate unnecessary joins, set the
RELY constraint property on the UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY constraints.

Note

You are responsible for maintaining the integrity of your constraints (UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, and FOREIGN KEY). If the integrity
of your constraints is not maintained, the query results might differ if the RELY constraint property is set (compared to the
results with NORELY).

## Examples of Eliminating Unnecessary Joins

The following examples demonstrate cases in which Snowflake eliminates joins and references to tables that are not necessary:

- [Example 1: Eliminating an Unnecessary Left Outer Join](#label-join-elimination-example-left-outer)
- [Example 2: Eliminating an Unnecessary Self-Join](#label-join-elimination-example-self)
- [Example 3: Eliminating an Unnecessary Join on a Primary Key and Foreign Key](#label-join-elimination-example-primary-foreign)

In these examples:

- `dim_products` is a table that contains a row for each product available for purchase.

  In this table, `product_id` is a column that uniquely identifies a product.
- `fact_sales` is a table that contains a row for each sale of a product.

  In this table, `product_id` is a column that identifies the product that was sold. The IDs in this column correspond to the
  IDs in the `product_id` column of the `dim_products` table.

### Example 1: Eliminating an Unnecessary Left Outer Join

The following is an example of an unnecessary left outer join that Snowflake can optimize:

Copy code

```
SELECT f.*
FROM fact_sales f
LEFT OUTER JOIN dim_products p
ON f.product_id = p.product_id;
```

The join is unnecessary because the statement does not refer to any columns in the `dim_products` table on the right (other than
the primary key column for the join).

If the `dim_products.product_id` column has the UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint with the RELY property, Snowflake can identify
this join as unnecessary and can eliminate the reference to the `dim_products` table on the right.

### Example 2: Eliminating an Unnecessary Self-Join

The following is an example of an unnecessary self-join that Snowflake can optimize:

Copy code

```
SELECT p1.product_id, p2.product_name
FROM dim_products p1, dim_products p2
WHERE p1.product_id = p2.product_id;
```

The statement unnecessarily joins the `dim_products` table with itself and selects columns from that table.

If the `dim_products.product_id` column has the UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint with the RELY property, Snowflake can identify
this join as unnecessary and can eliminate the reference to the `dim_products` table on the right.

### Example 3: Eliminating an Unnecessary Join on a Primary Key and Foreign Key

The following is an example of an unnecessary inner join that Snowflake can optimize.

Copy code

```
SELECT p.product_id, f.units_sold
FROM   fact_sales f, dim_products p
WHERE  f.product_id = p.product_id;
```

The statement does not refer to any columns in the `dim_products` table on the right, other than the primary key column for the
join.

If the `dim_products.product_id` column has the PRIMARY KEY constraint and the `fact_sales.product_id` column has the FOREIGN
KEY constraint, Snowflake can identify this join as unnecessary and can eliminate the reference to the `dim_products` table on
the right.
