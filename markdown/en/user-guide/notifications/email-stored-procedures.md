# Using SYSTEM$SEND\_EMAIL to send email notifications

Note

Email notifications are processed through Snowflake’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments, using AWS Simple Email Service
(SES). The content of an email message sent using AWS may be retained by Snowflake for up to thirty days to manage the delivery
of the message. After this period, the message content is deleted.

This topic explains how to use the built-in [SYSTEM$SEND\_EMAIL](/sql-reference/stored-procedures/system_send_email) stored procedure to send
email notifications.

## Introduction

This feature uses the [notification integration](/user-guide/notifications/email-notifications#label-create-email-notification-integration) object, which is a Snowflake
object that provides an interface between Snowflake and third-party services (e.g. cloud message queues, email, etc.).

## Sending an email notification

Before you send a notification, you must have a notification integration that you will use to send the notification. You must also
validate the email addresses of the recipients. For details, see [Notifications in Snowflake](/user-guide/notifications/about-notifications).

To send the email notification, call the [SYSTEM$SEND\_EMAIL](/sql-reference/stored-procedures/system_send_email) stored procedure.

For example, to use the notification integration `my_email_int` to send an email message with the subject line
“Email Alert: Task A has finished.” to `first.last@example.com` and `first2.last2@example.com`, execute the following statement:

Copy code

```
CALL SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL(
    'my_email_int',
    'first.last@example.com, first2.last2@example.com',
    'Email Alert: Task A has finished.',
    'Task A has successfully finished.\nStart Time: 10:10:32\nEnd Time: 12:15:45\nTotal Records Processed: 115678'
);
```

Note

If you set the ALLOWED\_RECIPIENTS property of the notification integration, and any email address in the recipient list is not
on that list, no email notifications are sent.

If you are on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, then the email notification message is sent from
`no-reply@snowflake.net`. If you are on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Microsoft Azure (Azure)
cloud platform, the email notification message is sent from `do-not-reply@snowflake.net`.
