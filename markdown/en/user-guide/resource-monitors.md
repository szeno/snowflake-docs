# Working with resource monitors

A *resource monitor* can help control costs and avoid unexpected credit usage caused by running warehouses. A
[virtual warehouse](/user-guide/warehouses-overview) consumes Snowflake credits while it runs. You can use a resource monitor
to monitor credit usage by virtual warehouses and the cloud services needed to support those warehouses. You can also set up a resource
monitor to suspend a standard virtual warehouse or disable an [Adaptive Warehouse](/user-guide/warehouses-adaptive) when it reaches a
credit limit.

Important

Resource monitors work for warehouses only. You can’t use a resource monitor to track spending associated with serverless
features and AI services. To monitor credit consumption by these features, use a [budget](/user-guide/budgets) instead.

The number of credits consumed depends on the size of the warehouse and how long it runs. For more information on warehouse credit usage,
see [Virtual warehouse credit usage](/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute#label-virtual-warehouse-credit-usage).

Credit usage limits can be set for a specified interval or date range. When a limit is reached and/or reaches a specified threshold,
the resource monitor can trigger various actions, such as sending alert notifications, suspending standard warehouses, or disabling
Adaptive Warehouses.

Only users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create a resource monitor, but an account administrator can grant privileges to other roles
to allow other users to view and modify resource monitors.

## Resource monitor properties

A resource monitor is a first-class object in Snowflake, consisting of the following properties:

### Credit quota

Credit quota specifies the number of Snowflake credits allocated to the monitor for the specified frequency interval. Any number can be specified.

In addition, Snowflake tracks the *used credits/quota* within the specified frequency interval by all warehouses assigned to the monitor.
At the specified interval, this number resets to `0`.

Credit quota accounts for credits consumed by both user-managed virtual warehouses and virtual warehouses used by cloud services.

For example, your resource monitor limit is set at 1000 credits. If your warehouse consumes 700 credits, and cloud services consume 300
credits within a specified interval or date range, an alert will be triggered.

Note

Resource monitor limits do not take into account the daily 10% adjustment for cloud services. Snowflake uses all credit consumption by
the cloud services layer to calculate whether a limit has been reached, even if that consumption is never billed. For more information
about how cloud services credits and adjustments are calculated, see [Understanding billing for cloud services usage](/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute#label-understanding-billing-for-cloud-services-usage).

For instructions on how to view your cloud services credit usage, see [Exploring compute cost](/user-guide/cost-exploring-compute).

### Monitor type

This property specifies whether the resource monitor is used to monitor your account or a specific set of individual warehouses:

- An *account monitor* monitors the credit usage of all the warehouses in the account. An account can only have one account monitor.
- A *warehouse monitor* monitors the credit usage of the warehouses assigned to the resource monitor. An account can have multiple
  warehouse monitors.

  A warehouse monitor can have one or more warehouses assigned to it, but each warehouse can only be assigned to one resource monitor.

If this property is not set, the resource monitor doesn’t monitor any credit usage. It simply remains dormant.

For more information, see [Assignment of resource monitors](#label-resource-monitor-assignment).

### Schedule

The default schedule for a resource monitor specifies that it starts monitoring credit usage immediately and the used credits reset to
`0` at the beginning of each calendar month (i.e. the start of the standard Snowflake billing cycle).

However, you can optionally customize the schedule for a resource monitor using the following properties:

Frequency:
:   The interval at which the used credits reset relative to the specified start date.

    Supported values:

    - Daily
    - Weekly
    - Monthly
    - Yearly
    - Never (used credits never reset; assigned warehouses continue using credits until the credit quota is reached)

Start:
:   Date and time (i.e. timestamp) when the resource monitor starts monitoring the assigned warehouses.

    Supported values:

    - Immediately (i.e. current timestamp)
    - Later (i.e. any future timestamp)

    In addition, Snowflake uses this date to determine when to reset the used credits, based on the specified frequency. Note, however, that
    regardless of the time specified in the start date and time, resource monitors reset at 12:00 AM UTC. For example, if the start is
    15-July-2019 (Monday) at 8:00 AM:

    - Frequency = Monthly: Used credits reset at 12:00 AM UTC on the 15th of each following month.
    - Frequency = Weekly: Used credits reset at 12:00 AM UTC on each following Monday.

    Note that, if you specify the last day of a month as the start date, Snowflake resets the used credits on the last day of all following
    months, regardless of the number of days in the month. For example, if you set the start date to January 31, Snowflake subsequently resets
    the used credits for the resource monitor on February 28 (or February 29 in a leap year), March 31, April 30, and so on.

End:
:   Date and time (i.e. timestamp) when Snowflake suspends the warehouses associated with the resource monitor, regardless of whether the
    used credits reached any of the thresholds defined for the resource monitor’s actions (see the next section in this topic).

    Supported values: Any future timestamp.

    Note that this property is not commonly used.

Important

If you choose to customize the schedule for a resource monitor, the frequency is relative to the specified start date, which is
different than the default schedule.

Also, if you specify a frequency, you must also specify a start date and time, and vice versa (i.e. you cannot set one without setting the
other).

### Actions

Also referred to as *triggers*, each action specifies a threshold, as a percentage of the credit quota for the resource monitor, and the
action to perform when the threshold is reached within the specified interval. Note that actions support thresholds greater than `100`.

Resource monitors support the following actions:

Notify & Suspend:
:   Send a notification and suspend all assigned standard warehouses after all statements being executed by the warehouse(s) have completed.
    For [Adaptive Warehouses](/user-guide/warehouses-adaptive), this action disables the warehouse after running statements complete.

Notify & Suspend Immediately:
:   Send a notification and suspend all assigned standard warehouses immediately, which cancels any statements being executed by the
    warehouses at the time. For Adaptive Warehouses, this action disables the warehouse immediately.

Notify:
:   Perform no action on warehouses, but send a notification.

Notifications are sent to all account administrators with notifications enabled. Email notifications for resource monitors that monitor
warehouses are also sent to any [non-administrator user that is enabled](#label-resource-monitors-enabling-nonadministrator-notifications)
to receive those notifications.

Note

Non-administrator users can only receive email notifications for *warehouse* monitors.

Each resource monitor can have the following actions:

- One **Suspend** action.
- One **Suspend Immediate** action.
- Up to five **Notify** actions.

Note

A resource monitor must have at least one action defined; if no actions have been defined, nothing happens when the used credits reach
the threshold.

## Assignment of resource monitors

A single monitor can be set at the account level to control credit usage for all warehouses in your account.

In addition, a one or more warehouses can be assigned to a resource monitor, thereby controlling the credit usage for each assigned
warehouse. Note, however, that a warehouse can be assigned to only a single resource monitor below the account level.

The following diagram illustrates a scenario in which one resource monitor is set at the account level and individual warehouses are
assigned to two other resource monitors:

![Warehouse and resource monitor relationships](/static/images/resource-monitor.png)

Based on this diagram:

- The credit quota for the entire account is 5000 for the interval (month, week, etc.), as controlled by Resource Monitor 1; if this quota
  is reached within the interval, the actions defined for the resource monitor (**Suspend**, **Suspend Immediate**, etc.) are enforced for
  all five warehouses.
- Warehouse 3 can consume a maximum of 1000 credits within the interval.
- Warehouse 4 and 5 can consume a maximum combined total of 2500 credits within the interval.

Note that the actual credits consumed by Warehouses 3, 4, and 5 may be less than their quotas if the quota for the account is reached first.

Important

- An account-level resource monitor does not override resource monitor assignment for individual warehouses. If either the account
  resource monitor or the warehouse resource monitor reaches its defined threshold and a suspend action has been defined, standard
  warehouses are suspended and [Adaptive Warehouses](/user-guide/warehouses-adaptive) are disabled.
- An account-level resource monitor does not control credit usage by the Snowflake-provided compute resources for serverless features (for
  example, Snowpipe, automatic reclustering, and materialized views).

## Warehouse suspension and resumption

The used credits for a resource monitor reflect the sum of credits consumed by all assigned warehouses within the specified interval,
along with the cloud services used to support those warehouses during the same interval. If a monitor has a **Suspend** or **Suspend
Immediately** action defined and its used credits reach the threshold for the action, assigned standard warehouses are suspended. Assigned
[Adaptive Warehouses](/user-guide/warehouses-adaptive) are disabled. Affected warehouses cannot be resumed or enabled until one of the
following conditions is met:

- The next interval, if any, starts, as dictated by the start date for the monitor.
- The credit quota for the monitor is increased.
- The credit threshold for the suspend action is increased.
- The warehouses are no longer assigned to the monitor.
- The monitor is dropped.

### Adaptive Warehouses

For Adaptive Warehouses, **Suspend** and **Suspend Immediate** in resource monitor configuration are synonyms for **disable**. The
warehouse `STATE` is `DISABLED`, and `DISABLED_REASONS` can list the resource monitor. Adaptive Warehouses don’t use suspend and resume the
same way as standard warehouses.

When a resource monitor’s conditions clear, an Adaptive Warehouse is **enabled** again (the same outcome as `ALTER WAREHOUSE ... ENABLE`).
You can also disable or enable an Adaptive Warehouse with `ALTER WAREHOUSE`. For more information, see
[Enable or disable an Adaptive Warehouse](/user-guide/warehouses-adaptive#label-adaptive-warehouse-enable-disable).

A warehouse-level resource monitor can monitor, but cannot suspend, credit usage by cloud services. After a standard virtual warehouse is
suspended or an Adaptive Warehouse is disabled, subsequent queries run against that warehouse can still result in additional cloud
services costs. For more information about credit usage for cloud services, see [Cloud service credit usage](/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute#label-cloud-services-credit-usage).

Tip

Resource monitors are not intended for strictly controlling consumption on an hourly basis; they are intended for tracking and
controlling credit consumption per interval (day, week, month, etc.). Also, they are not intended for setting precise limits on credit
usage (i.e. down to the level of individual credits). For example, when credit quota thresholds are reached for a resource monitor, the
assigned warehouses may take some time to suspend or disable, even when the action is **Suspend Immediate**, thereby consuming additional
credits.

If you wish to strictly enforce your quotas, we recommend the following:

- Utilize buffers in the quota thresholds for actions (e.g. set a threshold to 90% instead of 100%).

  This will help ensure that your credit usage doesn’t exceed the quota.
- To more strictly control credit usage for individual warehouses, assign only a single warehouse to each resource monitor.

  When multiple warehouses are assigned to the same resource monitor, they share the same quota thresholds, which may result in credit
  usage for one warehouse impacting the other assigned warehouses.

## Resource monitor notifications

When a resource monitor reaches the threshold for an [action](#label-resource-monitors-actions), it generates a notification
similar to the following notification:

```
Resource Monitor MY_ACCOUNT_MONITOR has reached 50% of its MONTHLY
quota of 500 credits which has triggered a <action> action.
```

The `<action>` is one of the following actions:

- NOTIFY
- SUSPEND
- SUSPEND\_IMMEDIATE

Notification behavior depends on the [type](#label-resource-monitors-type) of resource monitor and whether or not notifications
are [enabled](#label-enabling-notifications) for an individual user. Notifications are sent as follows:

- For *warehouse* monitors, a notification is sent to the following users:

  - All account administrators who have enabled resource monitor notifications.
  - Non-administrator users in the notification list for the resource monitor.
- For *account* monitors, a notification is sent to the following users:

  - The account administrator with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the resource monitor if they have enabled notifications.
  - All account administrators who have enabled notifications using Snowsight.

  Note

  A non-administrator user can’t be added to the notification list for an *account* monitor.

Important

Resource monitor notifications can be sent by email or in Snowsight, but are disabled by default. You must set up
notifications before they are sent. Users that do not have the ACCOUNTADMIN role can only be sent email notifications.

To enable notifications, see [Enabling receipt of notifications](#label-enabling-notifications).

## DDL for resource monitors

Snowflake provides the following DDL commands for creating and using/managing resource monitors:

- [CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR](/sql-reference/sql/create-resource-monitor)
- [ALTER RESOURCE MONITOR](/sql-reference/sql/alter-resource-monitor)
- [SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS](/sql-reference/sql/show-resource-monitors)
- [DROP RESOURCE MONITOR](/sql-reference/sql/drop-resource-monitor)

In addition, the following DDL commands can be used to assign a resource monitor to a warehouse and determine whether a warehouse is assigned to
a monitor:

- [CREATE WAREHOUSE](/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse) or [ALTER WAREHOUSE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-warehouse)
- [SHOW WAREHOUSES](/sql-reference/sql/show-warehouses)

## Access control privileges for resource monitors

By default, resource monitors can only be created by account administrators and, therefore, can only be viewed and maintained by them.

However, roles that have been granted the following privileges on specific resource monitors can view and modify the resource monitor as
needed using SQL:

- MONITOR
- MODIFY

For more information, see [Access control privileges](/user-guide/security-access-control-privileges) and [GRANT <privileges> … TO ROLE](/sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege).

Note that only account administrators can view and manage resource monitors via the Snowsight.

## Enabling receipt of notifications

Before you can receive any notifications from resource monitors, you must enable notifications in the web interface and verify your email.

Snowsight:
:   To enable notifications, follow these steps:

    1. Verify your email address if you haven’t already done so. For instructions on how to verify your email address, see
       [Verify your email address](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-profile#label-snowsight-verify-email-address).
    2. Select your username, then select **Profile**
    3. For **Notifications**, select **Enable notifications from resource monitors**.

       Note

       - If you haven’t verified your email address, the **Notifications** option isn’t available until you verify your email.
       - In **Notifications**, the **Enable notifications from resource monitors** option is only available to users with
         the ACCOUNTADMIN role in the following cases:
         - If there is a resource monitor assigned to the account and the account administrator has the OWNERSHIP privilege
           on the account monitor.
         - If there are warehouse monitors in the account. All account administrators can receive notifications for warehouse monitors.

## Creating resource monitors

Resource monitors can be created through either the web interface or SQL; however, only account administrators (i.e. users with the
ACCOUNTADMIN role) can create resource monitors.

A resource monitor can’t be assigned more than 500 warehouses.

Important

You must assign at least one warehouse to a resource monitor or set the monitor at the account level for it to begin
monitoring/tracking credit usage:

- In the web interface, you are required to do this at creation time.
- In SQL, you must create the resource monitor first, then assign one or more warehouses to it by executing [ALTER WAREHOUSE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-warehouse) as a separate,
  additional step.

Also, to receive notifications when resource monitor actions are triggered, you must
[enable notifications](#label-enabling-notifications).

### Creating a resource monitor with a default schedule

You can create a resource monitor that uses the default schedule using the web interface or SQL.

Note

Only users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create resource monitors.

Snowsight:
:   1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
    2. In the navigation menu, select **Admin** » **Cost management**.
    3. Select **Resource Monitors**, then select **+ Resource Monitor**.
    4. For **Name**, enter a name for the resource monitor.
    5. For **Credit Quota**, enter the number of credits for each specified interval.
    6. Select the **Monitor Type**. Choose **Account** to create an account monitor or
       choose **Warehouse** to select the warehouses to monitor.
    7. For **Actions**, choose which notifications to enable by entering a threshold next to the option. You must select at
       least one option.

       Select **Add** to create additional notifications. You can specify up to five notify actions.

SQL:
:   In SQL, this task is performed in two steps:

    1. Execute a [CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR](/sql-reference/sql/create-resource-monitor) command, but do not specify any scheduling properties.
    2. Execute an [ALTER WAREHOUSE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-warehouse) statement to assign warehouses to the resource monitor or
       an [ALTER ACCOUNT](/sql-reference/sql/alter-account) statement to set the resource monitor for the account.

    For example:

    - To create a monitor that starts monitoring immediately, resets at the beginning of each month, and suspends the assigned warehouse
      when the used credits reach 100% of the credit quota:

      Copy code

      ```
      USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

      CREATE OR REPLACE RESOURCE MONITOR limit1 WITH CREDIT_QUOTA=1000
        TRIGGERS ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND;

      ALTER WAREHOUSE wh1 SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = limit1;
      ```

      The SUSPEND action waits for currently executing queries to finish before suspending the warehouse. A query might start before the
      threshold is reached and complete after the SUSPEND action is triggered. In this case, the warehouse continues to consume credits
      even after the quota is reached.
    - To create a similar monitor that suspends at 90% and suspends immediately at 100% after the quota has been reached:

      Copy code

      ```
      USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

      CREATE OR REPLACE RESOURCE MONITOR limit1 WITH CREDIT_QUOTA=1000
        TRIGGERS ON 90 PERCENT DO SUSPEND
              ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE;

      ALTER WAREHOUSE wh1 SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = limit1;
      ```

      In this example, a notification is sent and the assigned warehouses are suspended when 90% of the credit quota is reached.
      Currently executing queries complete, but the resource monitor prevents the warehouses from executing any new queries.
      If the assigned warehouses reach 100% of the credit quota, a notification is sent and the warehouses are suspended immediately,
      canceling all currently executing queries. This prevents all warehouses in the account from consuming credits.
    - To create a monitor that is similar to the first example, but lets the assigned warehouse exceed the quota by 10% and also includes two
      notification actions to alert account administrators as the used credits reach the halfway and three-quarters points for the quota:

      Copy code

      ```
      USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

      CREATE OR REPLACE RESOURCE MONITOR limit1 WITH CREDIT_QUOTA=1000
      TRIGGERS ON 50 PERCENT DO NOTIFY
               ON 75 PERCENT DO NOTIFY
               ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND
               ON 110 PERCENT DO SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE;

      ALTER WAREHOUSE wh1 SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = limit1;
      ```

      In this example:

      - When 50% and 75% usage is reached, an alert notification is sent to all account administrators who have enabled notifications, but no
        other actions are performed.
      - When 100% usage is reached, the assigned warehouse is suspended.
      - If the warehouse is still running when 110% usage is reached, it is suspended immediately.

### Creating a resource monitor with a custom schedule

You can create a resource monitor that uses a schedule other than the default using the web interface or SQL.

Note

Only users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create resource monitors.

Complete the following steps to create a resource monitor with a custom schedule:

Snowsight:
:   1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
    2. In the navigation menu, select **Admin** » **Cost management**.
    3. Select **Resource Monitors**, then select **+ Resource Monitor**.
    4. For **Name**, enter a name for the resource monitor.
    5. For **Credit Quota**, enter the number of credits for each specified interval.
    6. Select the **Monitor Type**. Choose **Account** to create an account monitor or
       choose **Warehouse** to select the warehouses to monitor.
    7. Select **Schedule** » **Customize** to set a custom schedule for the specified interval. You can skip this step to use the
       [default schedule](#label-resource-monitors-schedule).

       You can set a custom start and end date using **Custom Start Date** and **Custom End Date**, or specify a date range
       by using the **Range** tab.

       Note

       If you choose to end monitoring at a specified date and time, all assigned warehouses are suspended on that date and time even
       if the credit quota has not been reached. A notification is sent when this occurs that states the resource monitor has reached
       a percentage of its quota and has triggered a suspend immediate action. The percentage of the quota reflects the number
       of used credits in the current interval up to the end date and might not be a threshold you specified.

       You can also customize the specified interval for monitoring. Select **Resets** and you can select from the following periodic
       intervals at which to reset the credit quota:

       - **Monthly**
       - **Daily**
       - **Weekly**
       - **Yearly**
       - **Never**
    8. For **Actions**, choose which notifications to enable by entering a threshold next to the option. You must select at
       least one option.

       Select **Add** to create additional notifications. You can specify up to five notify actions.
    9. For **Actions and Notifications**, enable a given action or notification by entering a threshold next to the option.
       You must select at least one option.

       Select **+Add more notification thresholds** to create additional notifications. You can specify up to five notify actions.

SQL:
:   Execute a [CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR](/sql-reference/sql/create-resource-monitor) command, with one or more of the following scheduling properties:

    - FREQUENCY
    - START\_TIMESTAMP
    - END\_TIMESTAMP

    For example:

    - To create an account-level resource monitor that starts immediately (based on the current timestamp), resets monthly on the same day,
      has no end date or time, and suspends the assigned warehouse when the used credits reach 100% of the quota:

      Copy code

      ```
      USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

      CREATE OR REPLACE RESOURCE MONITOR limit1 WITH CREDIT_QUOTA=1000
       FREQUENCY = MONTHLY
       START_TIMESTAMP = IMMEDIATELY
       TRIGGERS ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND;

      ALTER WAREHOUSE wh1 SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = limit1;
      ```
    - To create a resource monitor that starts at a specific date and time in the future, resets weekly on the same day, has no end date or
      time, and performs two different suspend actions at different thresholds on two assigned warehouses:

      Copy code

      ```
      USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

      CREATE OR REPLACE RESOURCE MONITOR limit1 WITH CREDIT_QUOTA=2000
       FREQUENCY = WEEKLY
       START_TIMESTAMP = '2019-03-04 00:00 PST'
       TRIGGERS ON 80 PERCENT DO SUSPEND
                ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE;

      ALTER WAREHOUSE wh1 SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = limit1;

      ALTER WAREHOUSE wh2 SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = limit1;
      ```

Note

You cannot change the customized schedule for a resource monitor back to the default. You must drop the monitor and create a new monitor.

## Modifying a resource monitor

You can modify the following properties for an existing resource monitor:

- Increase or decrease the credit quota for the monitor.
- Customize the schedule (frequency, start timestamp, and end timestamp) for the monitor.
- Add or remove actions, or modify the threshold percentages for existing actions.
- If the monitor is monitoring your account, convert it to monitor individual warehouses.
- If the monitor is monitoring individual warehouses:
  - Add or remove warehouses from the list.
  - Convert it to monitor your account.

Note

Changing any of these properties does not affect the used credits to-date for the monitor. All changes only affect used credits
after the changes are saved.

Resource monitors can be modified through the web interface or SQL.

Note

The following privileges are required to modify the properties of a resource monitor:

- To modify the credit quota, schedule, or actions for a resource monitor, a user must use a role with the MODIFY
  privilege on the resource monitor.
- To modify the monitor type for a resource monitor from warehouse to account or vice versa, a user must use the
  ACCOUNTADMIN role.
- To modify the list of warehouses for a warehouse-level resource monitor, a user must use the ACCOUNTADMIN role.

Snowsight:
:   1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
    2. In the navigation menu, select **Admin** » **Cost management**.
    3. Select **Resource Monitors**, then select a resource monitor.
    4. Select the **More** menu (**…**) in top right corner. Select **Edit**.

SQL:
:   - To change the quota, customize the schedule, or add/remove/modify actions, execute an
      [ALTER RESOURCE MONITOR](/sql-reference/sql/alter-resource-monitor) statement.

      For example, to increase the credit quota for resource monitor `limit1` to `3000`, execute the following statement:

      Copy code

      ```
      ALTER RESOURCE MONITOR limit1 SET CREDIT_QUOTA=3000;
      ```

      For more examples, see [Examples](/sql-reference/sql/alter-resource-monitor#label-alter-resource-monitor-examples).

    - To change the monitor type, execute an [ALTER WAREHOUSE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-warehouse) or [ALTER ACCOUNT](/sql-reference/sql/alter-account) statement.

      For example, to change resource monitor `my_rm` which currently monitors warehouses to monitor
      the account `my_account`, execute the following steps:

      1. Find all the warehouses the resource monitor `my_rm` is monitoring. Check the `resource_monitor` column for
         `my_rm`:

         Copy code

         ```
         SHOW WAREHOUSES;
         ```

         Returns the following results:

         ```

         ```

         Resource monitor `my_rm` is monitoring two warehouses `my_wh2` and `my_wh3`.
      2. Remove the resource monitor for both warehouses by executing the following statements:

         Copy code

         ```
         ALTER WAREHOUSE my_wh2 UNSET RESOURCE_MONITOR;

         ALTER WAREHOUSE my_wh3 UNSET RESOURCE_MONITOR;
         ```
      3. Change the resource monitor to monitor the account by executing the following statement:

         Copy code

         ```
         ALTER ACCOUNT my_account SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = my_rm;
         ```

Note

If a resource monitor has a customized schedule, you cannot change the schedule back to the default. You must drop the monitor and
create a new monitor.

## Send resource monitor notifications to non-administrator users

Non-administrator users can only receive email notifications for [warehouse monitors](#label-resource-monitors-type). Each non-administrator
user must have a verified email address. You can add up to five non-administrator users to a warehouse monitor using the CREATE RESOURCE
MONITOR or ALTER RESOURCE MONITOR command.

For example, to add users `user1` and `user2` to the warehouse monitor `my_warehouse_rm`, execute the following
statement:

Copy code

```
ALTER RESOURCE MONITOR my_warehouse_rm
  SET NOTIFY_USERS = (USER1, USER2);
```

Note

If any user in the notification list does not have a verified email, the statement fails.

For more information, see the [NOTIFY\_USERS parameter](/sql-reference/sql/alter-resource-monitor#label-alter-resource-monitor-notify-users) and
[Usage notes](/sql-reference/sql/alter-resource-monitor#label-alter-resource-monitor-usage-notes) in the [ALTER RESOURCE MONITOR](/sql-reference/sql/alter-resource-monitor) topic.

To add non-administrator users to the notification list for a resource monitor when you create a resource monitor using SQL, see
[CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR](/sql-reference/sql/create-resource-monitor).

## Setting a resource monitor for your account

A resource monitor can be set for your account through the web interface or SQL.

Note

Only users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can set a resource monitor to monitor the account.

Snowsight:
:   You can set the monitor type to account when you create a resource monitor. For more information,
    see [Creating resource monitors](#label-resource-monitors-creating).

SQL:
:   In SQL, this task is performed in two steps:

    1. Use the [CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR](/sql-reference/sql/create-resource-monitor) command to create the resource monitor (if it doesn’t already exist).

       If the resource monitor does exist, to change a warehouse level resource monitor to monitor an account, see the
       [example in the Modifying a Resource Monitor section](/user-guide/resource-monitors#label-resource-monitor-modify-type).
    2. Use the [ALTER ACCOUNT](/sql-reference/sql/alter-account) command to set the resource monitor you created as the monitor for your account.

       For example, to set the account resource monitor to `my_account_rm`, execute the following statements:

       Copy code

       ```
       USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

       CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR my_account_rm WITH CREDIT_QUOTA=10000
         TRIGGERS ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND;

       ALTER ACCOUNT SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = my_account_rm;
       ```

    To change the monitor type of an existing resource monitor from a warehouse monitor to an account monitor, see the
    [example in the Modifying a Resource Monitor section](/user-guide/resource-monitors#label-resource-monitor-modify-type).

To view whether a resource monitor is set for your account, use the web interface or the [SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS](/sql-reference/sql/show-resource-monitors)
command. The `LEVEL` column for a resource monitor displays whether it is set for your account or individual warehouses.

Important

- An account-level resource monitor only controls the virtual warehouses explicitly created in your account; it does not control credit
  usage by the Snowflake-provided warehouses for serverless features (for example, [Snowpipe](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-intro),
  [Automatic Clustering](/user-guide/tables-auto-reclustering), and [materialized views](/user-guide/views-materialized)).
- A warehouse-level resource monitor can monitor, but cannot suspend, credit usage by cloud services. The monitor can only
  suspend the user-managed virtual warehouses created in your account. After a user-managed virtual warehouse is suspended, subsequent
  queries run against that warehouse can still result in additional cloud services costs. For more information about credit usage for cloud
  services, see [Cloud service credit usage](/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute#label-cloud-services-credit-usage).

## Assigning warehouses to a resource monitor

Warehouses can be assigned to an existing resource monitor through the web interface or SQL.

Note

Only users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can assign warehouses to resource monitors.

Snowsight:
:   1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
    2. In the navigation menu, select **Admin** » **Cost management**.
    3. Select **Resource Monitors**, then select a resource monitor.
    4. Select the **More** menu (**…**) in top right corner. Select **Edit**.
    5. If **Monitor Type** is **Account**, select **Warehouse**.
    6. Select **Warehouse** to choose the warehouses to monitor.

SQL:
:   Use the [ALTER WAREHOUSE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-warehouse) command to assign a warehouse to a resource monitor.

    For example, to monitor warehouse `my_wh` with the resource monitor `my_rm`, execute the following statement:

    > Copy code
    >
    > ```
    > ALTER WAREHOUSE my_wh SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = my_rm;
    > ```

## Viewing resource monitors

Resource monitors can be viewed through the web interface or SQL.

Snowsight:
:   1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
    2. In the navigation menu, select **Admin** » **Cost management**.
    3. Select **Resource Monitors** to see a list of resource monitors for which your role has been granted the MODIFY or MONITOR
       privilege. Account administrator users can see all resource monitors.
    4. Select a resource monitor to view detailed information about resource monitor settings, current credit usage, and a list of
       roles with privileges on the resource monitor.
    5. Select **Account** [![Account tab](/static/images/screens/ui-navigation-account-icon.svg)](/static/images/screens/ui-navigation-account-icon.svg) » **Resource Monitors**.

SQL:
:   Using the ACCOUNTADMIN role or a role that has been granted the MONITOR or MODIFY privilege on the resource monitor, execute
    a [SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS](/sql-reference/sql/show-resource-monitors) statement.

    In addition, using any role, you can execute a [SHOW WAREHOUSES](/sql-reference/sql/show-warehouses) statement to view the warehouses owned
    by the role (or for which the role has been granted USAGE privilege). The output includes the resource monitor, if any, to which
    the warehouse is assigned.

Note

For [provider accounts](/user-guide/data-sharing-gs) that have created reader accounts, Snowflake provides an additional view,
[RESOURCE\_MONITORS](/sql-reference/account-usage/resource_monitors). This view can be used for querying resource monitor usage
in the provider’s reader accounts. For more information, see [Account Usage](/sql-reference/account-usage).

## Replicating resource monitors

[Business Critical Feature](/user-guide/intro-editions)

Resource monitor replication requires Business Critical (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).

Resource monitors can be replicated from a source account to target accounts using a
[replication or failover group](/user-guide/account-replication-intro#label-replication-and-failover-groups). For more information, see
[Resource monitor replication](/user-guide/account-replication-intro#label-resource-monitor-replication).
