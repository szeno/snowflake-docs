# Controlling network traffic with network policies

You can use network policies to control *inbound* access to the Snowflake service and internal stage.

If you want to control *outbound* traffic from Snowflake to an external network destination, see
[External network access overview](/developer-guide/external-network-access/external-network-access-overview).

Note

Network policies that existed before the introduction of network rules can no longer be modified in Snowsight. Use the
[ALTER NETWORK POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/alter-network-policy) command instead.

## About network policies

By default, Snowflake allows users to connect to the service and internal stage from any computer or device. A security administrator
(or higher) can use a network policy to allow or deny access to a request based on its origin. The *allowed list* of the network policy
controls which requests are allowed to access the Snowflake service or internal stage, while the *blocked list* controls which
requests should be explicitly blocked.

A network policy does not directly specify the network identifiers in its allowed list or blocked list. Rather, a network policy adds
*network rules* to its allowed and blocked lists. These network rules group related identifiers into logical units that are added to the
allowed list and blocked list of a network policy.

Important

Network policies that existed before the introduction of network rules still work. However, all new network policies should use network
rules, not the `ALLOWED_IP_LIST` and `BLOCKED_IP_LIST` parameters, to control access from IP addresses. Best practice is to
avoid using both ways to restrict access in the same network policy.

### Workflow

The following list shows the general workflow of using network policies to control inbound network traffic:

1. [Create network rules](#label-network-policy-network-rules) based on their purpose and type of network identifier.
2. [Create one or more network policies](#label-network-policy-create-policy) that include the network rules that contain the
   identifiers to be allowed or blocked.
3. [Activate the network policy for an account, user, or security integration](#label-associating-network-policies). A network policy
   doesn’t restrict network traffic until it is activated.

### Interaction between allowed lists and blocked lists

When you add a network rule to the allowed list of a network policy, you do not have to use the blocked list to explicitly block other
identifiers of the same type; only the allowed identifiers have access. For example, if you add an IPv4 network rule with a single IP
address to the allowed list, all other IPv4 addresses are blocked. There is no need to use the blocked list to restrict access from other
IP addresses.

If a network policy has the same IP address values in both the `ALLOWED_IP_LIST` and the `BLOCKED_IP_LIST` parameters, Snowflake
applies the values in the `BLOCKED_IP_LIST` parameter first. This behavior also applies to the `ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST` and
the `BLOCKED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST` parameters.

[Private connectivity](/user-guide/private-connectivity-inbound) network rules — that is, network rules of type AWSVPCEID or
AZURELINKID — take precedence over IPV4 and IPV6 network rules. If an incoming request uses private connectivity and there is a network
rule of type AWSVPCEID or AZURELINKID in the `ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST` property, then all IPV4 and IPV6 network rules that contain
public or private IP ranges are ignored.

When a network policy includes both IPV4 and IPV6 network rules, Snowflake evaluates both rule types independently for each incoming
request. If a request arrives over IPv6 and no IPv6 network rules are present in the policy, the request is evaluated against IPv4
rules only.

A network rule that uses private endpoint identifiers such as Azure LinkIDs or AWS VPCE IDs to restrict access has no effect
on requests coming from the public network. If you want to restrict access based on private endpoint identifiers, and then completely
block requests from public IPv4 addresses, you must create two separate network rules, one for the allowed list and another for the blocked
list.

The following network rules could be combined in a network policy to allow a VPCE ID while blocking public network traffic.

Copy code

```
CREATE NETWORK RULE block_public_access
  MODE = INGRESS
  TYPE = IPV4
  VALUE_LIST = ('0.0.0.0/0');

CREATE NETWORK RULE allow_vpceid_access
  MODE = INGRESS
  TYPE = AWSVPCEID
  VALUE_LIST = ('vpce-0fa383eb170331202');

CREATE NETWORK POLICY allow_vpceid_block_public_policy
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST = ('allow_vpceid_access')
  BLOCKED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST=('block_public_access');
```

#### IP ranges

If you want to allow a range of IP addresses with the exception of a single IP address, you can create two network rules, one for the
allowed list and another for the blocked list.

For example, the following would allow requests from all IP addresses in the range of `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.255`, except
`192.168.1.99`. IP addresses outside the range are also blocked.

Copy code

```
CREATE NETWORK RULE allow_access_rule
  MODE = INGRESS
  TYPE = IPV4
  VALUE_LIST = ('192.168.1.0/24');

CREATE NETWORK RULE block_access_rule
  MODE = INGRESS
  TYPE = IPV4
  VALUE_LIST = ('192.168.1.99');

CREATE NETWORK POLICY public_network_policy
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST = ('allow_access_rule')
  BLOCKED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST=('block_access_rule');
```

### Network policy precedence

You can apply a network policy to an account, a security integration, or a user. If there are network policies applied to more than one
of these, the most specific network policy overrides more general network policies. The following summarizes the order of precedence:

Account:
:   Network policies applied to an account are the most general network policies. They are overridden by network policies applied to a
    security integration or user.

User:
:   Network policies applied to a user override network policies applied to the account, but are overridden by a network
    policy applied to a security integration.

Security Integration:
:   Network policies applied to a security integration are the most specific network policies. They override both accounts and users.

    Note

    For [Snowflake OAuth](/user-guide/oauth-snowflake-overview), the user-level network policy is not considered for
    client-to-Snowflake traffic such as token requests. Only the integration-level and account-level policies apply. The exception is the
    built-in `SNOWFLAKE$LOCAL_APPLICATION` integration, which also enforces the user-level policy on token requests.
    For more information, see [Restricting network traffic for Snowflake OAuth](/user-guide/oauth-snowflake-overview#label-snow-oauth-network-policies).

### Bypassing a network policy

It is possible to temporarily bypass a network policy for a set number of minutes by configuring the user object property
`MINS_TO_BYPASS_NETWORK_POLICY`, which can be viewed by executing [DESCRIBE USER](/sql-reference/sql/desc-user). Only Snowflake can set the
value for this object property. Please contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support) to set a value for this property.

## About network rules

While restrictions on incoming requests to Snowflake are ultimately applied to an account, user, or security integration with a network
policy, the administrator can organize these restrictions using [network rules](/user-guide/network-rules), which are schema-level
objects.

Each network rule groups together the identifiers for a particular type of request origin. For example, one network rule
might include all of the IPv4 addresses that should be allowed to access Snowflake while another groups together all of the private
endpoints that should be blocked.

A network rule, however, does not specify whether it is allowing or blocking the origin of a request. It simply organizes
related origins into a logical unit. Administrators specify whether that unit should be allowed or blocked when they create
or modify a network policy.

If you already understand the strategies for using network rules with network policies, see [Working with network rules](#label-network-rule-working-with).

### Best practices

- **Limit the scope**. Network rules are designed to group together small units of related network identifiers. Previously, network
  policies often contained a large, monolithic list of IP addresses that should be allowed or blocked. The introduction of network rules
  changes this strategy. For example, you could break up network identifiers by:

  - Creating a network rule to contain client IP addresses for the North American region, and a different rule for the Europe and Middle
    Eastern region.
  - Creating a network rule whose purpose is to allow access for a special population, such as highly privileged users and service account
    users. This network rule can be added to a network policy that is applied to individual users.
  - Creating a network rule that is scoped to one or more data apps.

  With the introduction of network rules, Snowflake recommends that you also limit the scope of network policies. Whenever possible,
  narrowly scope a network policy to a group of users or a security integration rather than an entire account.
- **Add comments**. When creating a network rule, use the `COMMENT` property to keep track of what the rule is supposed to do.
  Comments are important because Snowflake encourages a large number of small targeted rules over fewer monolithic ones.

  You can use the SHOW NETWORK RULES command to list all of the network rules, including their comments.

### Supported identifiers

Each network rule contains a list of one or more network identifiers of the same type (e.g. an IPv4 address rule or a private endpoint rule).

A network rule’s `TYPE` property identifies what type of identifiers the network rule contains.

For a complete list of the types of identifiers that can be restricted using network rules, see [Supported network identifiers](/user-guide/network-rules#label-network-rule-identifiers).

### Protecting the Snowflake service

This section discusses how to use network rules to restrict access to the Snowflake service only. If you want to restrict access to both the
service and the internal stage of an account on AWS, see [Protecting internal stages on AWS](#label-network-policies-rules-stages).

To restrict access to the Snowflake service, set the `MODE` property of the network rule to `INGRESS`.

You can then use the `TYPE` property to specify the [identifiers](/user-guide/network-rules#label-network-rule-identifiers) that should be allowed or
blocked.

### Protecting internal stages on AWS

This section discusses how to use network rules to restrict access to internal stages on AWS, including how to simultaneously restrict
access to the Snowflake service and internal stage. It includes:

- [Limitations](#label-network-policies-rules-stages-limitations)
- [Prerequisite: Enabling internal stage restrictions](#label-network-policies-rules-stages-enable)
- [Guidelines for internal stages](#label-network-policies-rules-stages-best-practices)
- [Strategy for protecting the internal stage only](#label-network-policies-rules-stages-only)
- [Strategies for protecting both service and internal stage](#label-network-policies-rules-stages-strategies)

Note

You cannot use a network rule to restrict access to an internal stage on Microsoft Azure. However, you can block all public access to an
internal stage on Azure if you are using
[Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview). For details, see [Blocking public access — \*Recommended\*](/user-guide/private-internal-stages-azure#label-private-internal-stage-azure-block-public).

#### Limitations

- A network policy that is activated for a security integration does not restrict access to an internal stage.

#### Prerequisite: Enabling internal stage restrictions

To use network rules to restrict access to the internal stage of an account, the account administrator must enable the [ENFORCE\_NETWORK\_RULES\_FOR\_INTERNAL\_STAGES](/sql-reference/parameters#label-enforce-network-rules-for-internal-stages) parameter. Network rules do not protect an internal stage until this parameter is
enabled, regardless of the rule’s mode.

To allow network rules to restrict access to internal stages, execute:

Copy code

```
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
ALTER ACCOUNT SET ENFORCE_NETWORK_RULES_FOR_INTERNAL_STAGES = true;
```

#### Guidelines for internal stages

We recommend that you follow these guidelines when creating network policies and network rules to restrict access to internal stages.

- **Limit the number of identifiers**. Network policies used to protect an internal stage cannot contain an unlimited number of network
  identifiers. The limits vary depending on your Snowflake edition.

  Note

  If a network policy has more than one network rule, the combined number of identifiers from all network rules cannot exceed the limit
  for the network policy.

  - **Standard and Enterprise editions**:

    - Maximum number of IPv4 address ranges is 10 per network rule.
    - Maximum number of VPCE IDs is 7 per network policy.
  - **Business Critical edition and higher**:

    - Maximum number of IPv4 address ranges is approximately 250 per network policy.
    - Maximum number of VPCE IDs is approximately 200 per network policy.
    - Maximum number of network policies is 50. If you need to increase this limit, contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).
- **Use same rule to protect both service and internal stage**. When a rule contains IPv4 addresses and the mode of a network rule is
  `INGRESS`, a single rule can protect both the Snowflake service and the internal stage of the account. Snowflake recommends using a
  single rule even when the IP addresses accessing the service are different from the IP addresses accessing the internal stage. This
  approach improves organization, manageability, and auditing.

  Note

  IPv6 network rules (`TYPE=IPV6`) protect the Snowflake service only. They don’t protect internal stages. If your network uses
  both IPv4 and IPv6, create IPv4 network rules to protect the internal stage.
- **Test Network Policies**. Snowflake recommends testing network rules using user-level network policies. If you encounter
  `PolicySizeExceeded` exceptions when fetching the scoped credentials from AWS STS, break up the network identifiers into smaller network
  rules.

#### Strategy for protecting the internal stage only

To restrict access to an AWS internal stage without affecting how network traffic accesses the Snowflake service, create a network rule with
the following settings:

- Set the `MODE` parameter to `INTERNAL_STAGE`.
- Set the `TYPE` parameter to `AWSVPCEID`.

Note

You cannot restrict access to the internal stage based on the IP address of the request without also restricting access to the Snowflake
service.

#### Strategies for protecting both service and internal stage

When restricting access to both the Snowflake service and internal stage, the implementation strategy varies based on whether network
traffic is traversing the public internet or AWS Private Link.

In the following comparison, “Public” indicates that traffic to the service or internal stage is traversing the public internet while
“Private” indicates traffic is using AWS Private Link. Find the combination that matches your environment, and then choose the
implementation strategy accordingly.

| Service Connection | Internal Stage Connection | Implementation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public | Public | Create a single network rule with `TYPE=IPV4` and `MODE=INGRESS`. Include all IP addresses that access the service and internal stage. |
| Private | Private | Strategy depends on whether you want to restrict access using private IP addresses or the VPCE ID of the VPC endpoints:   - **(Recommended)** If using VPCE IDs, you must create two network rules, even if the same VPC endpoint is connecting to both the   service and the internal stage.    - For the service, create a network rule with `TYPE=AWSVPCEID` and `MODE=INGRESS`.   - For the internal stage, create a network rule with `TYPE=AWSVPCEID` and `MODE=INTERNAL_STAGE`. - If using private IP addresses, create a network rule with `TYPE=IPV4` and `MODE=INGRESS`. Include all private IP addresses that   access the service and internal stage. |
| Public [[1]](#footnote-1) | Private | Strategy depends on whether you want to restrict access to the internal stage using private IP addresses or VPCE ID of the VPC endpoints:   - **(Recommended)** If using VPCE IDs, create two network rules, one for the service and one for the internal stage.    - For the service, create a network with `TYPE=IPV4` and `MODE=INGRESS`.   - For the internal stage, create a network rule with `TYPE=AWSVPCEID` and `MODE=INTERNAL_STAGE`. - If using private IP addresses, create a single network rule with `TYPE=IPV4` and `MODE=INGRESS`. Include all IP addresses that   access the service and internal stage. |
| Private | Public [[1]](#footnote-1) | You must use private IPs for the service (cannot use VPCE IDs). Create a single network rule with `TYPE=IPV4` and `MODE=INGRESS`. Include all IP addresses that access the service and internal stage. |

[1]
If you have implemented private connectivity to either the service or the internal stage, Snowflake recommends implementing it for both.

Note

The strategies in this table use `TYPE=IPV4` network rules. IPv6 network rules (`TYPE=IPV6`) protect the Snowflake service
only and can’t be used to protect internal stages. If your clients connect over both IPv4 and IPv6, use IPv4 network rules
for internal stage protection and create additional IPv6 network rules for the Snowflake service.

### Protecting Snowflake-managed storage volumes on AWS

This section discusses how to use network rules to restrict access to Snowflake-managed storage volumes on AWS, including how to
simultaneously restrict access to the Snowflake service and Snowflake-managed storage volume. For information about using
Snowflake-managed storage volumes with Apache Iceberg™ tables, see [Snowflake storage for Apache Iceberg™ tables](/user-guide/tables-iceberg-internal-storage).

This section includes:

- [Limitations](#label-network-policies-rules-snowflake-managed-storage-volumes-limitations)
- [Prerequisite: Enabling Snowflake-managed storage volume restrictions](#label-network-policies-rules-snowflake-managed-storage-volumes-enable)
- [Guidelines for Snowflake-managed storage volumes](#label-network-policies-rules-snowflake-managed-storage-volumes-best-practices)
- [Strategy for protecting the Snowflake-managed storage volume only](#label-network-policies-rules-snowflake-managed-storage-volumes-only)

Note

You can’t use a network rule to restrict access to a Snowflake-managed storage volume on Microsoft Azure. However, you can block all
public access to a Snowflake-managed storage volume on Azure if you are using
[Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview). For details, see
[Blocking public access](/user-guide/private-managed-volumes-azure#label-private-snowflake-managed-storage-volumes-azure-block-public).

#### Limitations

- A network policy that is activated for a security integration does not restrict access to a Snowflake-managed storage volume.
- Network policies that protect Snowflake-managed storage volumes can only be applied at the account level

#### Prerequisite: Enabling Snowflake-managed storage volume restrictions

To use network rules to restrict access to the Snowflake-managed storage volume of an account, the account administrator must enable the
[ENFORCE\_NETWORK\_RULES\_FOR\_SNOWFLAKE\_MANAGED\_STORAGE\_VOLUME](/sql-reference/parameters#label-enforce-network-rules-for-snowflake-managed-storage-volume) parameter. Network rules don’t protect a Snowflake-managed storage
volume until this parameter is enabled, regardless of the rule’s mode.

To allow network rules to restrict access to Snowflake-managed storage volumes, execute:

Copy code

```
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
ALTER ACCOUNT SET ENFORCE_NETWORK_RULES_FOR_SNOWFLAKE_MANAGED_STORAGE_VOLUME = true;
```

#### Guidelines for Snowflake-managed storage volumes

We recommend that you follow these guidelines when creating network policies and network rules to restrict access to managed
storage volumes.

- **Limit the number of identifiers**. Network policies used to protect a Snowflake-managed storage volume can’t contain an unlimited
  number of network identifiers.

  Note

  If a network policy has more than one network rule, the combined number of identifiers from all network rules can’t exceed
  the limit for the network policy.

  - **All Snowflake editions**:
    - Maximum number of IPv4 address ranges is 10 per network rule.
    - Maximum number of VPCE IDs is 7 per network policy.

#### Strategy for protecting the Snowflake-managed storage volume only

To restrict access to an AWS Snowflake-managed storage volume without affecting how network traffic accesses the Snowflake service,
create a network rule with the following settings:

- Set the `MODE` parameter to `SNOWFLAKE_MANAGED_STORAGE_VOLUME`.
- Set the `TYPE` parameter to `AWSVPCEID`.

For example:

Copy code

```
CREATE NETWORK RULE managed_volume_rule
  TYPE = AWSVPCEID
  VALUE_LIST = ('vpce-123abc3420c1931')
  MODE = SNOWFLAKE_MANAGED_STORAGE_VOLUME;

CREATE NETWORK POLICY managed_volume_policy
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST = ('managed_volume_rule');

ALTER ACCOUNT SET NETWORK_POLICY = managed_volume_policy;
```

## Working with network rules

You can use Snowsight or SQL to manage the lifecycle of a network rule.

### Create a network rule

You need the CREATE NETWORK RULE privilege on the schema to create a network rule. By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN and SECURITYADMIN
roles, along with the schema owner, have this privilege.

The mode of a network rule that will be used by a network policy must be `INGRESS` or `INTERNAL STAGE`.

To gain a better understand of best practices and strategies for creating network rules, see [About network rules](#label-network-policy-network-rules).

You can create a network rule using Snowsight or by executing a SQL command:

Snowsight:
:   1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
    2. In the navigation menu, select **Governance & security** » **Network policies**, and then select the **Network Rules** tab.
    3. Select **+ Network Rule**.
    4. Enter the name of the network rule.
    5. Select the schema of the network rule. Network rules are schema-level objects.
    6. Optionally, add a descriptive comment for the network rule to help organize and maintain network rules in the schema.
    7. In the **Type** drop-down, select the [type of identifier](/user-guide/network-rules#label-network-rule-identifiers) being defined in the network
       rule. The **Host Port** type is not a valid option for network rules being used with network policies.
    8. In the **Mode** drop-down, select **Ingress** or **Internal Stage**. The **Egress** mode is not a valid option for network
       rules being used with network policies.
    9. Enter a comma-separated list of the identifiers that will be allowed or blocked when the network rule is added to a network policy. The
       identifiers in this list must all be of the type specified in the **Type** drop-down.
    10. Select **Create Network Rule**.

SQL:
:   An administrator can execute the [CREATE NETWORK RULE](/sql-reference/sql/create-network-rule) command to create a new network rule, specifying a list of
    network identifiers along with the type of those identifiers.

    For example, to use a custom role to create a network rule that can be used to allow or block traffic from a range of IP addresses:

    Copy code

    ```
    GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE securitydb TO ROLE network_admin;
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA securitydb.myrules TO ROLE network_admin;
    GRANT CREATE NETWORK RULE ON SCHEMA securitydb.myrules TO ROLE network_admin;
    USE ROLE network_admin;

    CREATE NETWORK RULE cloud_network TYPE = IPV4 VALUE_LIST = ('47.88.25.32/27');
    ```

### Modify a network rule

You can modify the network rule using Snowsight or SQL.

Snowsight:
:   1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
    2. In the navigation menu, select **Governance & security** » **Network policies**, and then select the **Network Rules** tab.
    3. Find the network rule, select the **…** button, and then select **Edit**.
    4. Modify the network rule as needed.
    5. Select **Update Network Rule**.

SQL:
:   Execute an [ALTER NETWORK RULE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-network-rule) statement.

## Working with network policies

Once you have grouped network identifiers into network rules, you are ready to add those network rules to the allowed list and blocked list
of a new or existing network policy. There is no limit on how many network rules can be added to a network policy.

For general information about how network policies control inbound access to the Snowflake service and internal stage, see
[About network policies](#label-network-policy-about).

### Create a network policy

Only security administrators (i.e. users with the SECURITYADMIN role) or higher or a role with the global CREATE NETWORK POLICY
privilege can create network policies. Ownership of a network policy can be transferred to another role.

Caution

`0.0.0.0/0` refers to all public and private IPv4 address ranges. Similarly, `::/0` refers to all IPv6 address ranges.
Use a network rule to block public access and add the network rule to the `BLOCKED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST` property of the network
policy.

The network policy evaluation considers any network rule properties before the `ALLOWED_IP_LIST` and `BLOCKED_IP_LIST`
network policy properties:

- The network rule `TYPE` property for `AWSVPCEID` and `AZURELINKID` takes precedence over any `TYPE = IPV4`
  value.
- If there are no network rules, the network policy evaluation considers the `ALLOWED_IP_LIST` and `BLOCKED_IP_LIST`
  network policy properties and their values.

Before you block all public access with a network rule, ensure that you have a network rule added to a network policy to allow access to
Snowflake. If you are using private connectivity to the Snowflake service, such as AWS PrivateLink, configure this service and update the
network rule and network policy accordingly.

If you try to create an empty network policy, no IPv4 addresses are allowed to access your Snowflake account.

Caution

When defining the network policy for a Snowflake Open Catalog account, ensure the allowed list of the network policy includes at least one IP
address that you intend to use to access the account. Otherwise, you may get locked out of the account.

You can create a network policy using [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in) or SQL:

Snowsight:
:   1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
    2. In the navigation menu, select **Governance & security** » **Network policies**, and then select the **Network Policies** tab.
    3. Select **+ Network Policy**.
    4. Enter the name of the network policy.
    5. Optionally, enter a descriptive comment.
    6. To add a network rule to the allowed list, select **Allowed**, and then select **Select rule**. You can add multiple network rules
       to the allowed list by re-selecting **Select rule**.
    7. To add a network rule to the blocked list, select **Blocked**, and then select **Select rule**. You can add multiple network rules
       to the blocked list by re-selecting **Select rule**.
    8. Select **Create Network Policy**.

SQL:
:   Execute a [CREATE NETWORK POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-network-policy) statement.

### Identify network policies in your account

You can identify the network policies in your account using Snowsight or SQL.

Snowsight:
:   1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
    2. In the navigation menu, select **Governance & security** » **Network policies**, and then select the **Network Policies** tab.

SQL:
:   Do one of the following:

    - Call the [POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/functions/policy_references) Information Schema table function.
    - Query the [POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/account-usage/policy_references) or
      [NETWORK\_POLICIES](/sql-reference/account-usage/network_policies) Account Usage view.
    - Run the [SHOW PARAMETERS](/sql-reference/sql/show-parameters) command as follows:

      Copy code

      ```
      SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'network_policy' IN ACCOUNT;
      ```

### Modify a network policy

You can add or remove network rules from the allowed list and blocked list of an existing network policy using Snowsight or SQL. If
you are editing a network policy that uses the `ALLOWED_IP_LIST` and `BLOCKED_IP_LIST` parameters instead of a network rule, you
must use SQL to modify the network policy.

Snowsight:
:   1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
    2. In the navigation menu, select **Governance & security** » **Network policies**, and then select the **Network Policies** tab.
    3. Find the network policy, select the **…** button, and then select **Edit**.
    4. To add a network rule to the allowed list, select **Allowed**, and then select **Select rule**. You can add multiple network rules
       to the allowed list by re-selecting **Select rule**.
    5. To add a network rule to the blocked list, select **Blocked**, and then select **Select rule**. You can add multiple network rules
       to the blocked list by re-selecting **Select rule**.
    6. To remove a network rule from the allowed list or blocked list of the network policy:
       1. Select **Allowed** or **Blocked**.
       2. Find the network rule in the list and select **X** to remove.

SQL:
:   Use the [ALTER NETWORK POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/alter-network-policy) command to add or remove network rules from an existing network policy.

    When adding a network rule to the allowed list or blocked list, you can either replace all existing network rules in the list or add the
    new rule while keeping the existing list. The following examples show each of these options:

    - Use the SET clause to replace network rules in the blocked list with a new network rule named `other_network`:

      Copy code

      ```
      ALTER NETWORK POLICY my_policy SET BLOCKED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST = ( 'other_network' );
      ```
    - Use the ADD clause to add a single network rule to the allowed list of an existing network policy. Network rules that were previously
      added to the policy’s allowed list remain in effect.

      Copy code

      ```
      ALTER NETWORK POLICY my_policy ADD ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST = ( 'new_rule' );
      ```

    You can also remove a network rule from an existing list without replacing the entire list. For example, to remove a network rule from
    the network policy’s blocked list:

    Copy code

    ```
    ALTER NETWORK POLICY my_policy REMOVE BLOCKED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST = ( 'other_network' );
    ```

## Activating a network policy

A network rule does not restrict inbound network traffic until it has been activated for an account, user, or security integration. For
instructions on how to activate at each level, see:

- [Activate a network policy for your account](#label-associating-network-policies-with-an-account)
- [Activate network policies for individual users](#label-associating-network-policies-user)
- [Activate network policies for security integrations](#label-associating-network-policies-integration)

If you are activating multiple network policies at different levels (for example, both account- and user-level network policies), see
[Network policy precedence](#label-network-policy-precedence).

### Activate a network policy for your account

Activating a network policy for an account enforces the policy for all users in the account.

Only security administrators (i.e. users with the SECURITYADMIN role) or higher or a role with the global ATTACH POLICY privilege
can activate a network policy for an account.

Once the policy is associated with your account, Snowflake restricts access to your account based on the allowed list and blocked
list. Any user who attempts to log in from an network origin restricted by the rules is denied access. In addition, when a network
policy is associated with your account, any restricted users who are already logged into Snowflake are prevented from executing further
queries.

You can create multiple network policies, however only one network policy can be associated with an account
at any one time. Associating a network policy with your account automatically removes the currently-associated network policy (if any).

Note that your current IP address or private endpoint identifier must be included in the allowed list in the policy. Otherwise, when you
activate the policy, Snowflake returns an error. In addition, your current identifier cannot be included in the blocked list.

If you want to determine whether there is already an account-level network policy before activating a new one, see
[Identify an activated network policy](#label-verify-network-policy-activation).

You can activate a network policy for your account using Snowsight or SQL:

Snowsight:
:   1. In the navigation menu, select **Governance & security** » **Network policies**, and then select the **Network Policies** tab.
    2. Find the network policy, select the **…** button, and then select **Activate**.
    3. Select **Activate policy**.

SQL:
:   Execute the [ALTER ACCOUNT](/sql-reference/sql/alter-account) statement to set the [NETWORK\_POLICY](/sql-reference/parameters#label-network-policy)
    parameter for the account. For example:

    Copy code

    ```
    ALTER ACCOUNT SET NETWORK_POLICY = my_policy;
    ```

### Activate network policies for individual users

To enforce a network policy for a specific user in your Snowflake account, activate the network policy for the user. Only a single network
policy can be activated for each user at a time. The ability to activate different network policies for different users allows for granular
control. Associating a network policy with a user automatically removes the currently-associated network policy (if any).

Note

A role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the user and USAGE privilege on the network policy, or a higher role, can activate a network policy
for an individual user.

Once the policy is associated with the user, Snowflake restricts access to the user based on the allowed list and blocked
list. If the user with an activated user-level network policy attempts to log in from a network location restricted by the rules, the user
is denied access to Snowflake.

In addition, when a user-level network policy is associated with the user and the user is already logged into Snowflake, if the user’s
network location does not match the user-level network policy rules, Snowflake prevents the user from executing further queries.

If you want to determine whether there is already a user-level network policy before activating a new one, see
[Identify an activated network policy](#label-verify-network-policy-activation).

To activate a network policy for an individual user, execute the [ALTER USER](/sql-reference/sql/alter-user) command to set the
[NETWORK\_POLICY](/sql-reference/parameters#label-network-policy) parameter for the user. For example, execute:

Copy code

```
ALTER USER joe SET NETWORK_POLICY = my_policy;
```

### Activate network policies for security integrations

Some security integrations support activating a network policy to control network traffic that is governed by that integration. These
security integrations have a NETWORK\_POLICY parameter that activates the network policy for the integration. Currently,
SCIM, Snowflake OAuth, and External OAuth support integration-level network policies.

You can also set `NETWORK_POLICY` on a [Data Connectivity Proxy](/user-guide/data-connectivity-proxy-security) object to restrict
which source IPs can connect to the DCP control plane.

Note

A network policy that is activated for a security integration does not restrict access to an internal stage.

For example, you could activate a network policy when creating a new Snowflake OAuth security integration. The network policy would restrict
the access of requests trying to authenticate.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION oauth_kp_int
>   TYPE = oauth
>   ENABLED = true
>   OAUTH_CLIENT = custom
>   OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = 'CONFIDENTIAL'
>   OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = 'https://example.com'
>   NETWORK_POLICY = mypolicy;
> ```

You can execute the ALTER SECURITY INTEGRATION … SET NETWORK\_POLICY statement to activate a network policy for an existing security
integration.

### Identify an activated network policy

You can identify which network policy is activated at the account, user, or integration level.

Account:
:   1. In the navigation menu, select **Governance & security** » **Network policies**, and then select the **Network Policies** tab.
    2. Sort the **Status** column to view the network policies.

       The **Status** column shows active and inactive network policies. Select the column value to view more details about the network
       policy, edit the policy, and delete the network policy. You can activate and deactivate a network policy that is set on your account.

    Alternatively, you can call the [POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/functions/policy_references) function and specify a network policy. The values in
    the `ref_entity_name` and `ref_entity_domain` columns for an individual row indicate the object on which the network policy
    is set.

## Using replication with network policies and network rules

Snowflake supports replication and failover/failback for network policies and network rules, including the assignment of the network policy.

For details, refer to [Replication of security integrations & network policies across multiple accounts](/user-guide/account-replication-security-integrations).
