# Automate continuous data loading with cloud messaging

Automated data loads leverage event notifications for cloud storage to inform Snowpipe of the arrival of new data files to load. Snowpipe
copies the files into a queue, from which they are loaded into the target table in a continuous, serverless fashion based on parameters
defined in a specified pipe object.

Note

- Automated Snowpipe uses event notifications to determine when new files arrive in monitored external stages in cloud storage and are ready to load. Notifications identify the cloud storage event and include a list of the file names. They do not include the actual data in the files.
- When a pipe is paused, event messages received for the pipe enter a limited retention period. The period is 14 days by default. If a
  pipe is paused for longer than 14 days, it is considered stale.

  Event notifications received while a pipe is paused are retained for only a limited period of time (14 days). As each notification
  reaches the end of this period, Snowflake schedules it to be dropped from the internal metadata. If the pipe is later resumed,
  Snowpipe may process notifications older than 14 days on a best effort basis. Snowflake cannot guarantee that these older
  notifications are processed.

  For information about resuming stale pipes, see [Managing Snowpipe](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-manage).

The following table indicates which cloud storage services are supported for automatically loading data in external stages into your Snowflake account using cloud storage event notifications, based on the [cloud platform](/user-guide/intro-cloud-platforms) that hosts your account:

| Snowflake Account Host | Amazon S3 | Google Cloud Storage | Microsoft Azure Blob storage | Microsoft Data Lake Storage Gen2 | Microsoft Azure General-purpose v2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amazon Web Services | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Google Cloud | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Microsoft Azure | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |

Snowflake recommends that you enable cloud event filtering for Snowpipe to reduce costs, event noise, and latency. For more information about configuring event filtering for each cloud provider, see the following pages:
