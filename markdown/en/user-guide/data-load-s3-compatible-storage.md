# Work with Amazon S3-compatible storage

This topic provides information about accessing Amazon S3-compatible storage from Snowflake.

A storage application or device is Amazon S3-compatible if it provides an application programming interface (API)
that is compliant with the industry-standard [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) REST API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html).
The Amazon S3 REST API enables CRUD operations and administrative actions on storage buckets and objects.

With Snowflake, you can use an external stage to connect to a growing number of S3-compatible storage solutions,
including on-premises storage and devices that exist outside of the public cloud.
The external stage stores an S3-compliant API endpoint, bucket name and path, and credentials.
To let users load and unload data from and to your storage locations, you grant privileges on the stage to roles.

You can use Snowflake support for Amazon S3-compatible storage to perform tasks such as:

- Querying data from an external stage without loading the data into Snowflake. For more information, see [Extend your data lake using external tables](#label-data-load-s3-compatible-extending-data-lake).
- Reading and processing unstructured data. To learn more, see [Download from an internal stage](/user-guide/unstructured-intro#label-data-load-processing-unstructured-data).
- Copying files in S3-compatible storage from one location to another using the [COPY FILES](/sql-reference/sql/copy-files) command.

Note

You can also create an external volume for S3-compatible storage to query an externally managed Apache Iceberg™ table. For more information, see
[Configure an external volume for S3-compatible storage](/user-guide/tables-iceberg-s3-compatible).

Note

To harden your security posture, you can configure an external stage to use private connectivity rather than the public Internet for network traffic. For more information, see [Private connectivity to S3-compatible stage](/user-guide/data-load-s3-compatible-private).

## Cloud platform support

This feature is available to Snowflake accounts hosted on the following supported [cloud platforms](/user-guide/intro-cloud-platforms):

- Amazon Web Services
- Google Cloud
- Microsoft Azure

## Requirements for S3-compatible storage

An S3-compatible API endpoint for Snowflake must meet the following requirements:

- Highly compliant with the S3 API and able to pass our [public test suite](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-s3compat-api-test-suite) (in GitHub).
  If the endpoint does not behave like S3, it cannot work with Snowflake.
- Supported by your third-party storage provider as a Snowflake S3-compatible tested and compliant service. For a list of vendors that have tested
  at least some of their products and found them to work with Snowflake, see [Vendor support for S3-compatible storage](#label-data-load-s3-compatible-vendors).
- Accessible from the public cloud where your Snowflake account is hosted.
- Highly available and performant to serve analytics needs.
- Configured to use virtual-hosted-style requests. For more information,
  see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the Amazon S3 documentation.
- Configured to use HTTPS communication with a valid TLS certificate.
- Configured to use direct credentials.
- Does not contain a port number. For example, the endpoint mystorage.com:3000 is not supported.

Important

Amazon S3-compatible endpoints are not automatically enabled for all accounts.

Cloudflare endpoints that contain `r2.cloudflarestorage.com` are enabled by default. To enable other endpoints, contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).
Before you send a request, verify the endpoints by using our [public test suite](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-s3compat-api-test-suite) (in GitHub).

Provide the following information with your request:

- Your Snowflake account name and cloud region deployment.
- The endpoint URL (for example, `my-s3-endpoint.example.com`).
- The software or hardware vendor that provides the endpoint.

## Create an external stage for S3-compatible storage

To create an external stage for S3-compatible storage, create a named [external stage](/user-guide/data-load-overview#label-data-load-overview-external-stages)
by using the [CREATE STAGE](/sql-reference/sql/create-stage) command.
You can use an external stage to perform actions such as listing files, loading data, and unloading files.

Optionally, add a [directory table](/user-guide/data-load-dirtables) to the external stage.
You can query a directory table to retrieve file URLs to access files in the referenced storage, as well as other metadata.

Note

When you add a directory table, you must set the AUTO\_REFRESH parameter to FALSE. The metadata for S3-compatible external stages cannot be refreshed automatically.

The following example creates an external stage named `my_s3_compat_stage` that points to the bucket and path named `my_bucket/files/` at the endpoint `mystorage.com`.
The AWS\_KEY\_ID and AWS\_SECRET\_KEY values used in this example are for illustration purposes only.

Copy code

```
CREATE STAGE my_s3compat_stage
  URL = 's3compat://my_bucket/files/'
  ENDPOINT = 'mystorage.com'
  CREDENTIALS = (AWS_KEY_ID = '1a2b3c...' AWS_SECRET_KEY = '4x5y6z...')
```

## Load and unload data

You can load and unload data using an external stage configured for S3-compatible storage. The following features work with S3-compatible storage:

- Bulk data loading using the [COPY INTO <table>](/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table) command.

  For example, load data into table `t1` from all files located in the `load` subpath in the bucket and path defined in a stage named `my_s3compat_stage`:

  Copy code

  ```
  COPY INTO t1
    FROM @my_s3compat_stage/load/;
  ```
- [Calling Snowpipe REST endpoints to continuously load data](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-rest-overview).

  For sample programs, see [Option 1: Load data with the Snowpipe REST API](/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-rest-load).
- Data unloading using the [COPY INTO <location>](/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location) command.

  For example, unload data from table `t2` into files in the `unload` subpath in the bucket and path defined in a stage named `my_s3compat_stage`:

  Copy code

  ```
  COPY INTO @my_s3compat_stage/unload/
    FROM t2;
  ```

## Extend your data lake using external tables

You can use external tables with S3-compatible storage to query data without first loading it into Snowflake.
This section briefly covers how to create and query an external table that references a location on an external stage configured for S3-compatible storage.

Start by creating an external table using [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/create-external-table) that references an S3-compatible external stage.

Note

The metadata for these external tables cannot be refreshed automatically. The `AUTO_REFRESH = TRUE` parameter setting is not supported.
You must manually refresh the metadata by executing an [ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE … REFRESH](/sql-reference/sql/alter-external-table) command
to register any added or removed files.

The following example creates an external table named `et` that references subpath `path1` in a stage named `my_s3compat_stage`.
The files in the `path1` subpath are in the Apache Parquet format.

Copy code

```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE et
 LOCATION=@my_s3compat_stage/path1/
 AUTO_REFRESH = FALSE
 REFRESH_ON_CREATE = TRUE
 FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = PARQUET);
```

After you create an external table for S3-compatible storage, you can query it. For example, query the `value` column in the external table created previously:

Copy code

```
SELECT value FROM et;
```

Query performance varies depending on network and application or device performance.
If performance is critical, create a [materialized view](/user-guide/views-materialized) on the external table.
Materialized views are pre-computed, so querying a materialized view is faster than executing a query against the base table of the view.

## Vendor support for S3-compatible storage

You can use devices or applications that have an S3-compliant API with Snowflake. However, your storage service provider is responsible for ensuring compliance.

The following vendors have indicated to Snowflake that they have tested at least some of their products and found them to work with Snowflake:

- Akave
- Backblaze
- Cloudflare
- Cloudian
- Cohesity
- Dell
- Hitachi Content Platform
- IBM Storage Ceph
- IDrive e2
- MinIO
- NetApp (StorageGRID)
- Nutanix
- PureStorage
- Scality
- Wasabi

This list is provided for convenience only. Snowflake does not test external products to validate compatibility and cannot fix issues
in products sold by third-party vendors. If you have questions about whether or how your hardware or software with an S3 API works with Snowflake,
contact the vendor directly.

## Test your S3-compatible API

If you are a hardware or software developer who has created an S3-compatible API,
you can use our [public test suite](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-s3compat-api-test-suite) (in GitHub)
to test whether your S3 API works with Snowflake. The test suite looks for obvious mismatches between your implementation and what Snowflake expects from S3.
However, there might be cases where the tests don’t identify incompatibility.

If you’re a customer and you want to test your own devices, contact your vendor to run these tests.
You can also run these public tests on your devices to assess compatibility.
