# Use the sample database

The sample database, SNOWFLAKE\_SAMPLE\_DATA, is identical to the databases that you create in your account, except that it is read-only.
As such, the following operations are not allowed:

- No DDL can be performed on the data set schemas (i.e. tables and other database objects cannot be added, dropped, or altered).
- No DML can be performed on the tables in the schemas.
- No cloning or Time Travel can be performed on the database or any schemas/tables in the database.

However, you can use all the same commands and syntax to view the sample database, schemas, and tables, as well as execute queries on the tables.

Important

The sample database is created by default for newer accounts. If the database has not been created for your account and you want
access to it, execute the following SQL statements with the ACCOUNTADMIN role active:

Copy code

```
-- Create a database from the share.
CREATE DATABASE SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA FROM SHARE SFC_SAMPLES.SAMPLE_DATA;

-- Grant the PUBLIC role access to the database.
-- Optionally change the role name to restrict access to a subset of users.
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA TO ROLE PUBLIC;
```

## View the sample database

You can view the sample database and its contents either in Snowsight or using SQL:

> Snowsight:
> :   In the navigation menu, select **Catalog** » **Explorer** » **SNOWFLAKE\_SAMPLE\_DATA**.
>
> SQL:
> :   Execute a [SHOW DATABASES](/sql-reference/sql/show-databases) command.
>
>     You can also use the relevant [SHOW <objects>](/sql-reference/sql/show) commands to view the objects in the sample database.

For example, in SQL:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> show databases like '%sample%';
>
> +-------------------------------+-----------------------+------------+------------+-------------------------+--------------+---------+---------+----------------+
> | created_on                    | name                  | is_default | is_current | origin                  | owner        | comment | options | retention_time |
> |-------------------------------+-----------------------+------------+------------+-------------------------+--------------+---------+---------+----------------|
> | 2016-07-14 14:30:21.711 -0700 | SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA | N          | N          | SFC_SAMPLES.SAMPLE_DATA | ACCOUNTADMIN |         |         | 1              |
> +-------------------------------+-----------------------+------------+------------+-------------------------+--------------+---------+---------+----------------+
> ```

Note that this example illustrates the sample database, SNOWFLAKE\_SAMPLE\_DATA, has been [shared with your account](/user-guide/data-sharing-intro) by Snowflake.

The `origin` column in the SHOW DATABASES output (or the **Origin** column in the **Databases** [![Databases tab](/static/images/screens/ui-navigation-database-icon.svg)](/static/images/screens/ui-navigation-database-icon.svg) page in the interface) displays the fully-qualified name of the shared
database, SFC\_SAMPLES.SAMPLE\_DATA, indicating it originated from the SFC\_SAMPLES account (used by Snowflake to share the sample data).

## Query tables and views in the sample database

To use a table or view in the sample database, you can either:

- Reference the fully-qualified name of the table in your query (in the form of `snowflake_sample_data.schema_name.object_name`).

  OR
- Specify the sample database (and schema) for your session using the [USE DATABASE](/sql-reference/sql/use-database) and/or [USE SCHEMA](/sql-reference/sql/use-schema) commands.

The following two examples illustrate using both approaches to query the `lineitem` table in the `tpch_sf1` schema:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> select count(*) from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf1.lineitem;
>
> +----------+
> | COUNT(*) |
> |----------|
> |  6001215 |
> +----------+
>
> use schema snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf1;
>
> select count(*) from lineitem;
>
> +----------+
> | COUNT(*) |
> |----------|
> |  6001215 |
> +----------+
> ```

Note

You must have a running, current warehouse in your session to perform queries. You set the current warehouse in a session using the [USE WAREHOUSE](/sql-reference/sql/use-warehouse)
command (or within the Worksheet in the web interface.)
