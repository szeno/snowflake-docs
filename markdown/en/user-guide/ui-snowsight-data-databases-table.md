# Working with tables in Snowsight

You can work with [tables](/guides-overview-db) in SQL or using Snowsight.
For details about the available SQL commands for working with tables, see [Table, view, & sequence DDL](/sql-reference/ddl-table)

In Snowsight, in the navigation menu, select **Catalog** » **Explorer**, and then search for or browse to the table.
Select the table to do any of the following:

- Explore details about the table and the columns defined in the table.
- Preview the data in the table.
- [Load data into the table from files](/user-guide/data-load-web-ui).
- Monitor the data loading activity for the table using the [table-level Copy History](/user-guide/data-load-monitor#label-table-copy-history).

Note

To work with tables in Snowsight, you must use a role with the relevant [table privileges](/user-guide/security-access-control-privileges#label-table-privileges).

## Explore table details in Snowsight

After opening a table in Snowsight, you can review the table name and the database and schema that contain the table.

![Table details shown for a standard table in Snowsight, described in the surrounding text.](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-data-table-details.png)

You can also review the following details:

- The type of table
- The owner role of the table
- When the table was created. Hover over the time to see the exact date and time.
- The number of rows in the table
- The size of the table. For example, 2.5 KB for a very small table.

You can review the SQL definition for the table on the **Table Details** tab in the **Table definition** section.
The **Columns** tab provides information about the columns in the table. Use the **Search** option to find columns by name.

Manage privileges for the table in the **Privileges** section of the **Table Details** tab.
See [Manage object privileges with Snowsight](/user-guide/security-access-control-configure#label-snowsight-manage-object-privileges).

## Manage a table in Snowsight

You can perform the following basic management tasks for a table in Snowsight:

- To edit the table name or add a comment, select [![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheet-explorer-ellipsis.png)](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheet-explorer-ellipsis.png) » **Edit**.
- To clone the table, select [![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheet-explorer-ellipsis.png)](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheet-explorer-ellipsis.png) » **Clone**.

- To [load data into the table from files](/user-guide/data-load-web-ui), select **Load Data**.

## Preview data in a table

The **Data Preview** tab provides a preview of up to the first 100 rows of the table.

Select [![More options](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheet-explorer-ellipsis.png)](/static/images/snowsight/snowsight-worksheet-explorer-ellipsis.png) to manipulate the preview data:

- Sort the data in ascending or descending order.
- Increase or decrease the decimal precision.
- Show thousands separators in numbers.
- Display the data in the column as percentages.

The options available to you depend on the type of data in the column.

Note

The preview requires a warehouse. By default, Snowsight uses the default warehouse for your user profile, or you can select
a different warehouse.
