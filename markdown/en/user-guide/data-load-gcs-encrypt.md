# Google Cloud Storage data file encryption

Cloud Storage always encrypts your data on the server side by default. Snowflake handles the encrypted files correctly.

In addition, Snowflake supports GCS buckets encrypted using a key stored in Cloud KMS on top of the default server-side encryption provided by GCS. The `GCS_SSE_KMS` encryption type accepts an optional `KMS_KEY_ID` value.
