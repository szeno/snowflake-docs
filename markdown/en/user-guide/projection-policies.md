# Projection policies

[Enterprise Edition Feature](/user-guide/intro-editions)

This feature requires Enterprise Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).

This topic shows how to use projection policies to allow or prevent column projection in the final output of a SQL query result.

## Overview

A projection policy is a first-class, schema-level object that defines whether a column can be projected in the output of a SQL query
result. A column with a projection policy assigned to it is said to be *projection constrained*. Projection policies can be used to
constrain sensitive or private information (for example, name or phone number) when [sharing data securely](/user-guide/data-sharing-gs) between partners.

However, note that columns that are hidden by projection policies can still be used in inner queries or in WHERE clauses, which can
disclose information about a given field. For details, see the [Considerations](#considerations) section (in this topic).

After creating the projection policy, a policy administrator can assign the projection policy to a column. A column can only have one
projection policy assigned to it at any given time. A user can project the column only if their active role matches a projection policy
condition that allows the column to be projected.

Note that a projection constrained column can also be protected by a masking policy and the table containing the projection constrained
column can be protected by a row access policy. For more details, see [Masking & row access policies](#label-projection-policy-masking-rap) (in this topic).

Projection policies affect only columns visible in the final results table. So a user running the following query would see NULL as indicated when column “protected\_C” denies projection:

Copy code

```
SELECT protected_C,                         -- NULL, in outer query
       my_func(protected_C),                -- Any functions on NULL returns NULL
       nonprotected_C
       FROM (SELECT protected_C,            -- Projection policies are ignored in a nested query.
                    nonprotected_C from T)
WHERE protected_C > 5;                      -- Not shown in results, so this works
```

### Column usage

Snowflake tracks column usage. Indirect references to a column, such as a view definition,
[UDF](#label-projection-constraint-udfs) (in this topic), and common table expression, impact column projection when a projection
policy is set on a column.

When a projection policy is set on the column and the column cannot be projected, the column:

- Is not included in the output of a query result.
- Cannot be inserted into another table.
- Cannot be an argument for an external function or stored procedure.

### Limitations

- For limitations regarding user-defined functions (UDFs), see [User-defined functions (UDFs)](#label-projection-constraint-udfs) (in this topic).
- A projection policy cannot be applied to:

  - A tag assigned to a table or column (that is, a tag-based projection policy).
  - A virtual column or to the VALUE column in an external table. As a workaround, create a view and assign a projection policy to each
    column that should not be projected.
  - The `value_column` in a [PIVOT](/sql-reference/constructs/pivot) construct. For related details, see
    [UNPIVOT](#label-projection-constraint-unpivot) (in this topic).
- A projection policy `body` cannot reference a column protected by a masking policy or a table protected by a row access
  policy. For additional details, see [Masking & row access policies](#label-projection-policy-masking-rap) (in this topic).

### Considerations

Use projection policies when the use case calls for querying a sensitive column without directly exposing the column value to an analyst or
similar role. The column value within a projection constrained column can be analyzed with greater flexibility than a masked or tokenized
value. However, consider the following prior to setting a projection policy on a column:

- A projection policy does not prevent the targeting of an individual.

  For example, a user can filter rows where the `name` column corresponds to a particular individual, even if the column is
  projection constrained. However, the user cannot run a SELECT statement to view names of the individuals in the table.
- When a projection constrained column is the join key for a query that combines data from the protected table with data from an unprotected
  table, nothing prevents the user from projecting values from the column in the unprotected table. As a result, if a value in the
  unprotected table matches a value in the protected column, the user can obtain that value by projecting it from the unprotected table.

  For example, suppose a projection policy was assigned to the `email` column of the `t_protected` table. A user can still ascertain
  values in the `t_protected.email` column by executing:

  Copy code

  ```
  SELECT t_unprotected.email
    FROM t_unprotected JOIN t_protected ON t_unprotected.email = t_protected.email;
  ```
- A projection constraint does not guarantee that a malicious actor could not use deliberate queries to obtain potentially sensitive data
  from a projection-constrained column. Projection policies are best suited for use with partners and customers with whom you have an
  existing level of trust. In addition, providers should be vigilant about potential misuses of their data (e.g. reviewing the access
  history for their listings).
- In rare instances, an error message for a query containing a projection-constrained column can contain a single value from the column.
- For all of these reasons, if you need to prevent leakage about a specific column or entity, you should omit the column entirely from
  your data, or employ [differential privacy](/user-guide/diff-privacy/differential-privacy-overview).

## Create a projection policy

A projection policy contains a `body` that calls the PROJECTION\_CONSTRAINT function to determine whether to project
a column.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> CREATE OR REPLACE PROJECTION POLICY <name>
>   AS () RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT -> <body>
> ```
>
> Where:
>
> - `name` specifies the name of the policy.
> - `AS () RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT` is the signature and return type of the policy. The signature does not accept any
>   arguments and the return type is PROJECTION\_CONSTRAINT, which is an internal data type. All projection policies have the same
>   signature and return type.
> - `body` is a SQL expression that determines whether to project the column. This can include CASE and other valid SQL
>   statements, and can also include SELECT clauses that evaluate to TRUE or FALSE. **Do not return NULL to disallow projection.** You
>   must return the PROJECTION\_CONSTRAINT function with values specifying whether to allow projection of the specified column,
>   and how to treat queries that request that column. See [CREATE PROJECTION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-projection-policy) to learn the syntax.

### Example policies

The simplest projection policies call the PROJECTION\_CONSTRAINT function directly:

Allow column projection
:   Copy code

    ```
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROJECTION POLICY mypolicy
    AS () RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT ->
    PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => true);
    ```

Prevent column projection
:   Copy code

    ```
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROJECTION POLICY mypolicy
    AS () RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT ->
    PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => false);
    ```

Prevent column projection to specific roles
:   More complicated SQL expressions can be written to call the PROJECTION\_CONSTRAINT function. The expression can use
    [Conditional expression functions](/sql-reference/expressions-conditional) and [Context functions](/sql-reference/functions-context) to introduce logic to allow certain users with a
    particular role to project a column and prevent all other users from projecting a column.

    Tip

    You can use the following strategies when using context functions in a conditional policy:

    - Context functions return strings, so comparisons using them are case-sensitive. You can use
      [LOWER](/sql-reference/functions/lower) to convert strings to all lowercase if you’d like to do a case-insensitive comparison.
    - The [POLICY\_CONTEXT](/sql-reference/functions/policy_context) function helps you evaluate whether a policy body is returning the correct value
      when a context function or [SYS\_CONTEXT](/sql-reference/functions/sys_context) property returns a certain value. The
      POLICY\_CONTEXT function simulates query results based upon a specified value of one or more context functions or SYS\_CONTEXT
      namespace properties, such as activated roles and agent types.

    The following example includes a [CASE](/sql-reference/functions/case) expression and [CURRENT\_ROLE](/sql-reference/functions/current_role) context
    function to create a conditional policy that allows only users with the `analyst` custom role to project a column:

    Copy code

    ```
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROJECTION POLICY mypolicy
    AS () RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT ->
    CASE
      WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'ANALYST'
        THEN PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => true)
      ELSE PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => false)
    END;
    ```

    The next example allows users with the `analyst` role to access the column, but anyone else will see only NULL values for that column or
    any column that derives from that column.

    Copy code

    ```
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROJECTION POLICY mypolicy
    AS () RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT ->
    CASE
      WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'ANALYST'
        THEN PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => true)
      ELSE PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => false, ENFORCEMENT => 'NULLIFY')
    END;
    ```

When an agent is active in the execution context
:   When an agent is active in the execution context, you can use [IS\_AGENT\_ACTIVATED](/sql-reference/functions/is_agent_activated) in a
    projection policy to prevent column projection even when the user’s role would otherwise allow access. When no agent is active, only the
    `ANALYST` custom role can project the column:

    Copy code

    ```
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROJECTION POLICY project_unless_agent AS ()
      RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT ->
      CASE
        WHEN SYS_CONTEXT('SNOWFLAKE$CURRENT', 'IS_AGENT_ACTIVATED')::BOOLEAN = TRUE
          THEN PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => false)
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'ANALYST'
          THEN PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => true)
        ELSE PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => false)
      END;
    ```

Using tags in projection policies:
:   The following example uses the [SYSTEM$GET\_TAG\_ON\_CURRENT\_COLUMN](/sql-reference/functions/system_get_tag_on_current_column) function so that a tag that is assigned to
    a column determines whether the column can be projected. In this case, when the policy is assigned to a column, the value of the
    `tags.accounting_col` tag on that column must be `public` in order to project the column.

    Copy code

    ```
    CREATE PROJECTION POLICY mypolicy
    AS () RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT ->
    CASE
      WHEN SYSTEM$GET_TAG_ON_CURRENT_COLUMN('tags.accounting_col') = 'public'
        THEN PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => true)
      ELSE PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => false)
    END;
    ```

For data sharing use cases, the provider can write a projection policy to constrain column projection for all consumer accounts using the
[CURRENT\_ACCOUNT](/sql-reference/functions/current_account) context function, or selectively restrict column projection in specific shares using the
[INVOKER\_SHARE](/sql-reference/functions/invoker_share) context function. For example:

Restrict all consumer accounts
:   In this example, `provider.account` is the [account identifier](/user-guide/admin-account-identifier#label-account-name) in the account name format:

    Copy code

    ```
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROJECTION POLICY restrict_consumer_accounts
    AS () RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT ->
    CASE
      WHEN CURRENT_ACCOUNT() = 'provider.account'
        THEN PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => true)
      ELSE PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => false)
    END;
    ```

Restrict to specific shares
:   Consider a data sharing provider account that has a projection policy set on a column of a secure view. There are two different shares
    (`SHARE1` and `SHARE2`) that can access the secure view to support two different data sharing consumers.

    If a user in the data sharing consumer account attempts to project the column through either share they can project the column,
    otherwise the column cannot be projected:

    Copy code

    ```
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROJECTION POLICY projection_share
    AS () RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT ->
    CASE
      WHEN INVOKER_SHARE() IN ('SHARE1', 'SHARE2')
        THEN PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => true)
      ELSE PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => false)
    END;
    ```

Query a separate table to determine the projection policy
:   You can use a SELECT query in your policy logic to help determine whether to allow or block projection. If you query a table (a
    *mapping table*) in this way, we recommend putting the mapping table in the same database as the protected table. This is particularly
    important if the `body` section calls [IS\_DATABASE\_ROLE\_IN\_SESSION](/sql-reference/functions/is_database_role_in_session).

    Here is an extended example of creating and populating a simple mapping table of role names and projection permission, and then querying
    that table to determine whether a column can be projected to the current user according to their role.

    Copy code

    ```
    -- Create mapping table with two columns: role name, whether that role can project the column
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE roles_with_access(role string, allowed boolean)
    AS SELECT * FROM VALUES ('ACCOUNTADMIN', true), ('RANDOM_ROLE', false);

    -- Create a policy that queries the mapping table, and allows projection when current
    -- user role has an `allowed` value of TRUE.
    -- Note that the logic is written to default to FALSE in all other cases, including the
    -- current role not being in the queried table.
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROJECTION POLICY pp AS () RETURNS projection_constraint ->
      CASE WHEN
        exists(
          SELECT 1 FROM roles_with_access WHERE role = current_role() AND allowed = true
        ) THEN projection_constraint(ALLOW=>true)
      ELSE projection_constraint(ALLOW=>false) END;

    -- Create a new table with the policy and query it in one step.
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE t(user string, address string WITH PROJECTION POLICY pp)
      AS SELECT * FROM VALUES ('Carson', 'CA'), ('Emily', 'NY'), ('John', 'NV');

    -- Succeeds
    USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
    SELECT * FROM t;

    -- Fails with projection policy error on column ADDRESS
    USE ROLE any_other_role;
    SELECT * FROM t;
    ```

## Assign a projection policy

A projection policy is applied to a table column using an [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](/sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column) command and a view column using an
[ALTER VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/alter-view) command. Each column supports only one projection policy.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER { TABLE | VIEW } <name>
> { ALTER | MODIFY } COLUMN <col1_name>
> SET PROJECTION POLICY <policy_name> [ FORCE ]
> [ , <col2_name> SET PROJECTION POLICY <policy_name> [ FORCE ] ... ]
> ```

Where:

- `name` specifies the name of the table or view.
- `col1_name` specifies the name of the column in the table or view.
- `col2_name` specifies the name of an additional column in the table or view.
- `policy_name` specifies the name of the projection policy set on the column.
- `FORCE` is an optional parameter that allows the command to assign the projection policy to a column that already has a projection
  policy assigned to it. The new projection policy atomically replaces the existing one.

For example, to set a projection policy `proj_policy_acctnumber` on the `account_number` column of a table:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER TABLE finance.accounting.customers
>  MODIFY COLUMN account_number
>  SET PROJECTION POLICY proj_policy_acctnumber;
> ```

You can also use the WITH clause of the [CREATE TABLE](/sql-reference/sql/create-table) and [CREATE VIEW](/sql-reference/sql/create-view) commands to assign
a projection policy to a column when the table or view is created. For example, to assign the policy `my_proj_policy` to the
`account_number` column of a new table, execute:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> CREATE TABLE t1 (account_number NUMBER WITH PROJECTION POLICY my_proj_policy);
> ```

You can also use the WITH clause when adding a new column to an existing table. For example, to assign the policy `my_proj_policy` to the
`zipcode` column, which is being added to the existing table `customers`, execute:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN account_number NUMBER WITH PROJECTION POLICY my_proj_policy;
> ```

### Replace a projection policy

The recommended method of replacing a projection policy is to use the `FORCE` parameter to detach the existing projection policy and
assign the new one in a single command. This allows you to atomically replace the old policy, leaving no gap in protection.

For example, to assign a new projection policy to a column that is already projection-constrained:

Copy code

```
ALTER TABLE finance.accounting.customers
  MODIFY COLUMN account_number
  SET PROJECTION POLICY proj_policy2 FORCE;
```

You can also detach the projection policy from a column in one statement (… UNSET PROJECTION POLICY) and then set a new policy on the
column in a different statement (… SET PROJECTION POLICY <name>). If you choose this method, the column is not protected by a projection policy
in between detaching one policy and assigning another. A query could potentially access sensitive data during this time.

## Detach a projection policy

Use the UNSET PROJECTION POLICY clause of an ALTER TABLE or ALTER VIEW command to detach a projection policy from the column of a table or
view. The name of the projection policy is not required because a column cannot have more than one projection policy attached.

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER { TABLE | VIEW } <name>
> { ALTER | MODIFY } COLUMN <col1_name>
> UNSET PROJECTION POLICY
> [ , <col2_name> UNSET PROJECTION POLICY ... ]
> ```

Where:

- `name` specifies the name of the table or view.
- `col1_name` specifies the name of the column in the table or view.
- `col2_name` specifies the name of an additional column in the table or view.

For example, to remove the projection policy from the `account_number` column:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> ALTER TABLE finance.accounting.customers
>  MODIFY COLUMN account_number
>  UNSET PROJECTION POLICY;
> ```

## View projection policies with Snowsight

To determine whether a column has a projection policy, do the following:

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Catalog** » **Database Explorer**, and then navigate to the table that contains the column.
3. Select the **Columns** tab.
4. Use the **Policy** column to determine if the column has any data governance policies.
5. Hover over each policy to determine whether it’s a projection policy.

   If it is a projection policy, you can also determine whether the projection policy prevents the query from executing or returns NULL
   values in the output. If the body of the policy is complex and behaves differently under different conditions, Snowsight
   displays the contents of the body instead of simply stating whether the query fails or returns NULL values.

## Monitor projection policies with SQL

It can be helpful to think of two general approaches to determine how to monitor projection policy usage.

- [Discover projection policies](#discover-projection-policies)
- [Identify projection policy references](#label-projection-constraint-policy-refs)

### Discover projection policies

You can use the [PROJECTION\_POLICIES](/sql-reference/account-usage/projection_policies) view in the Account Usage schema of the shared
SNOWFLAKE database. This view is a *catalog* for all projection policies in your Snowflake account. For example:

> Copy code
>
> ```
> SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.PROJECTION_POLICIES
> ORDER BY POLICY_NAME;
> ```

### Identify projection policy references

The [POLICY\_REFERENCES](/sql-reference/functions/policy_references) Information Schema table function can identify projection policy references. There
are two different syntax options:

1. Return a row for each object (that is, table or view) that has the specified projection policy set on a column:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE DATABASE my_db;
   SELECT policy_name,
       policy_kind,
       ref_entity_name,
       ref_entity_domain,
       ref_column_name,
       ref_arg_column_names,
       policy_status
   FROM TABLE(information_schema.policy_references(policy_name => 'my_db.my_schema.projpolicy'));
   ```
2. Return a row for each policy assigned to the table named `my_table`:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE DATABASE my_db;
   USE SCHEMA information_schema;
   SELECT policy_name,
       policy_kind,
       ref_entity_name,
       ref_entity_domain,
       ref_column_name,
       ref_arg_column_names,
       policy_status
   FROM TABLE(information_schema.policy_references(ref_entity_name => 'my_db.my_schema.my_table', ref_entity_domain => 'table'));
   ```

## Extended example

Creating a projection policy and assigning the projection policy to a column follows the same general procedure as creating and assigning
other policies, such as masking and row access policies:

1. For a centralized management approach, create a custom role (e.g. `proj_policy_admin`) to manage the policy.
2. Grant this role the privileges to create and assign a projection policy.
3. Create the projection policy.
4. Assign the projection policy to a column.

Based on this general procedure, complete the following steps to assign a projection policy to a column:

1. Create a custom role to manage the projection policy:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE useradmin;

   CREATE ROLE proj_policy_admin;
   ```
2. Grant the `proj_policy_admin` custom role the privileges to create a projection policy in a schema and assign the projection policy
   to any table or view column in the Snowflake account.

   This step assumes the projection policy will be stored in a database and schema named `privacy.projpolicies` and this database and
   schema already exist:

   Copy code

   ```
   GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE privacy TO ROLE proj_policy_admin;
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA privacy.projpolicies TO ROLE proj_policy_admin;

   GRANT CREATE PROJECTION POLICY
     ON SCHEMA privacy.projpolicies TO ROLE proj_policy_admin;

   GRANT APPLY PROJECTION POLICY ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE proj_policy_admin;
   ```

   For details, see [Privileges and commands](#label-projection-policy-manage) (in this topic).
3. Create a projection policy to prevent column projection:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE proj_policy_admin;
   USE SCHEMA privacy.projpolicies;

   CREATE OR REPLACE PROJECTION POLICY proj_policy_false
   AS () RETURNS PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT ->
   PROJECTION_CONSTRAINT(ALLOW => false);
   ```
4. Assign the projection policy to a table column:

   Copy code

   ```
   ALTER TABLE customers MODIFY COLUMN active
   SET PROJECTION POLICY privacy.projpolicies.proj_policy_false;
   ```

## Projection policies with Snowflake features

The following subsections briefly summarize how projection policies interact with various Snowflake features and services.

### Masking & row access policies

This section describes how a projection policy interacts with a [masking policy](/user-guide/security-column-intro) and a
[row access policy](/user-guide/security-row-intro).

Multiple policies:
:   A column can have a masking policy and a projection policy at the same time, and the table containing this column can be protected by a
    row access policy. If all three policies are present, Snowflake processes the table and policies as follows:

    1. Apply row filters according to the row access policy.
    2. Determine if the query is attempting to project any columns that are restricted by the projection policy, and if so, reject the query.
    3. Apply column masks according to the masking policy.

    A column protected by a masking policy can also be projection constrained. For example, a masking policy set on a column containing
    account numbers can have a condition that allows users with the `finance_admin` custom role to see the account numbers and another
    condition to replace the account numbers with a hash for all other roles.

    A projection policy can further restrict the column such that users with the `analyst` custom role cannot project the column. Note that
    users with the `analyst` custom role can still analyze the column by grouping hashes or joining on these hashes.

    Snowflake recommends that policy administrators work with internal compliance and regulatory officers to determine the columns that
    should be projection constrained.

Policy evaluation:
:   A projection constrained column cannot be referenced by a masking policy or a row access policy when:

    - Assigning a row access policy to a table.
    - Enumerating one or more columns in a [conditional masking policy](/user-guide/security-column-intro#label-security-column-intro-cond-cols).
    - Performing a mapping table lookup.

    As mentioned in the [Limitations](#label-projection-limitations) (in this topic), a projection policy `body` cannot reference a
    column protected by a masking policy or a table protected by a row access policy.

### Dependent objects with other projection policies

Consider the following series of objects:

> `base_table` » `v1` » `v2`
>
> Where:
>
> - `v1` is a view built from the table named `base_table`.
> - `v2` is a view built from `v1`.

If there is a query on a column in a view that is projection-constrained and that column depends on a projection constrained column in
`base_table`, the view column will be projected only if both projection policies allow the column to be projected.

Snowflake checks the column lineage chain all the way to the base table to ensure that any references to the column are not projection
constrained. If any column in the lineage chain is projection constrained and the column is not allowed to be projected, Snowflake blocks
the query.

### Views & materialized views

A projection policy on a view column constrains the view column and not the underlying base table column.

Regarding references, a projection policy that constrains a table column carries over to a view that references the constrained table
column.

### Streams & tasks

Projection policies on columns in a table carry over to a stream on the same table. Note that a projection policy cannot be set on a stream.

Similarly, a projection constrained column remains constrained when a task references the constrained column.

### UNPIVOT

The result of an [UNPIVOT](/sql-reference/constructs/unpivot) construct depends on whether a column was initially constrained by a
projection policy. Note:

- Constrained columns prior to and after executing UNPIVOT remain projection constrained.
- The `name_column` always appears in the query result.
- If any columns in the `column_list` are projection constrained, the `value_column` is also projection constrained.

### Cloned objects

The following approach helps to safeguard data from users with the SELECT privilege on a cloned table or view that is stored in the cloned
database or schema:

- Cloning an individual projection policy object is not supported.
- Cloning a schema results in the cloning of all projection policies within the schema.
- A cloned table maps to the same projection policies as the source table.
  - When a table is cloned in the context of its parent schema cloning, if the source table has a reference to a projection policy in the
    same parent schema (i.e. a local reference), the cloned table will have a reference to the cloned projection policy.
  - If the source table refers to a projection policy in a different schema (i.e. a foreign reference), then the cloned table retains the
    foreign reference.

For more information, see [CREATE <object> … CLONE](/sql-reference/sql/create-clone).

### Replication

Projection policies and their assignments can be replicated using database replication and replication groups.

For [database replication](/user-guide/database-replication-considerations), the replication operation fails if either of the
following conditions is true:

- The primary database is in an Enterprise (or higher) account and contains a policy but one or more of the accounts approved for
  replication are on lower editions.
- A table or view contained in the primary database has a [dangling reference](/user-guide/database-replication-considerations#label-database-replication-dangling-references) to a
  projection policy in another database.

The dangling reference behavior for database replication can be avoided when replicating multiple databases in a
[replication group](/user-guide/account-replication-intro#label-replication-and-failover-groups).

### User-defined functions (UDFs)

Note the following regarding projection constraints and UDFs:

Scalar SQL UDFs:
:   Snowflake evaluates the UDF and then applies the projection policy to the projection constrained column.

    If a column in a SELECT statement is transitively derived from a UDF, which is also derived from a projection constrained column,
    Snowflake blocks the query. In other words:

    `pc_column` » UDF » column (in SELECT statement)

    Where:

    - `pc_column` refers to a projection constrained column.

    Because the column in the SELECT statement can be traced to a projection constrained column, Snowflake blocks the query.

SQL UDTFs:
:   SQL user-defined table functions (UDTF) follow the same behavior as SQL UDFs, except that because rows are returned in the function
    output, Snowflake evaluates each table column independently to determine whether to project the column in the function output.

Other UDFs:
:   The following applies to [Introduction to Java UDFs](/developer-guide/udf/java/udf-java-introduction), [Introduction to JavaScript UDFs](/developer-guide/udf/javascript/udf-javascript-introduction),
    [Introduction to Python UDFs](/developer-guide/udf/python/udf-python-introduction):

    - A projection constrained column is constrained in the UDTF output.

Logging & Event Tables:
:   When a UDF, UDTF, or JavaScript UDF has a projection-constrained argument, Snowflake does not capture log and event details in the
    corresponding event table. However, Snowflake allows the UDF/UDTF to execute and does not fail the statement calling the UDF/UDTF due to
    logging reasons.

## Privileges and commands

The following subsections provide information to help manage projection policies.

### Projection policy privileges

Snowflake supports the following privileges on the projection policy object.

Operating on an object in a schema requires at least one privilege on the parent database and at least one privilege on the parent schema.

| Privilege | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| APPLY | Enables the set and unset operations for a projection policy on a column. |
| OWNERSHIP | Transfers ownership of the projection policy, which grants full control over the projection policy. Required to alter most properties of a projection policy. |

For details, see [Summary of DDL commands, operations, and privileges](#label-projection-policy-ddl-privilege-summary) (in this topic).

### Projection policy DDL reference

Snowflake supports the following DDL to create and manage projection policies.

- [CREATE PROJECTION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/create-projection-policy)
- [ALTER PROJECTION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/alter-projection-policy)
- [DESCRIBE PROJECTION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/desc-projection-policy)
- [DROP PROJECTION POLICY](/sql-reference/sql/drop-projection-policy)
- [SHOW PROJECTION POLICIES](/sql-reference/sql/show-projection-policies)

### Summary of DDL commands, operations, and privileges

The following table summarizes the relationship between projection policy privileges and DDL operations.

Operating on an object in a schema requires at least one privilege on the parent database and at least one privilege on the parent schema.

| Operation | Privilege required |
| --- | --- |
| Create projection policy. | A role with the CREATE PROJECTION POLICY privilege in the same schema. |
| Alter projection policy. | The role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the projection policy. |
| Describe projection policy | One of the following:   - A role with the global APPLY PROJECTION POLICY privilege, or - A role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the projection policy, or - A role with the APPLY privilege on the projection policy. |
| Drop projection policy. | A role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the projection policy. |
| Show projection policies. | One of the following:   - A role with the USAGE privilege on the schema in which the projection policy exists, or - A role with the APPLY PROJECTION POLICY on the account. |
| Set or unset a projection policy on a column. | One of the following:   - A role with the APPLY PROJECTION POLICY privilege on the account, or - A role with the APPLY privilege on the projection policy and the OWNERSHIP privilege on the table or view. |

Snowflake supports different permissions to create and set a projection policy on an object.

1. For a centralized projection policy management approach in which the `projection_policy_admin` custom role creates and sets projection
   policies on all columns, the following permissions are necessary:

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE securityadmin;
   GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE mydb TO ROLE projection_policy_admin;
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA mydb.schema TO ROLE projection_policy_admin;

   GRANT CREATE PROJECTION POLICY ON SCHEMA mydb.schema TO ROLE projection_policy_admin;
   GRANT APPLY ON PROJECTION POLICY ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE projection_policy_admin;
   ```
2. In a hybrid management approach, a single role has the CREATE PROJECTION POLICY privilege to ensure projection policies are named
   consistently and individual teams or roles have the APPLY privilege for a specific projection policy.

   For example, the custom role `finance_role` role can be granted the permission to set the projection policy `cost_center` on tables
   and views the role owns (i.e. the role has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the table or view):

   Copy code

   ```
   USE ROLE securityadmin;
   GRANT CREATE PROJECTION POLICY ON SCHEMA mydb.schema TO ROLE projection_policy_admin;
   GRANT APPLY ON PROJECTION POLICY cost_center TO ROLE finance_role;
   ```
