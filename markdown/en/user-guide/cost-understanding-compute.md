# Understanding compute cost

Compute costs represent [credits](#label-what-are-credits) used for:

- [Virtual Warehouse compute](#label-virtual-warehouse-credit-usage) — Virtual warehouses consume credits as they execute queries, load
  data and perform other DML operations. Virtual Warehouses are user-managed, which means you can directly
  control credit consumption of these resources.
- [Serverless compute](#label-serverless-credit-usage) —
  Serverless features use compute resources that are managed by Snowflake instead of using virtual warehouses.
- [Compute pools](#label-compute-pools-credit-usage) — Compute pools provide the compute resources for Snowpark Container Services.
- [Cloud Services compute](#label-cloud-services-credit-usage) — Cloud Services is the layer of the Snowflake architecture that
  performs services that tie together all the different components of Snowflake to process user requests, login, query display, and more.
  Cloud Services compute resources are managed by Snowflake.

## Virtual warehouse credit usage

A virtual warehouse is one or more clusters of compute resources that enable executing queries, loading data, and performing other DML
operations. The web interface and other features use warehouses, such as [Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment](/collaboration/provider-understand-cost-auto-fulfillment) or display information in dashboards.

[Snowflake credits](#label-what-are-credits) are used to pay for the processing time used by each virtual warehouse.
Snowflake credits are charged based on the number of virtual warehouses you use, how long they run, and their size.

Warehouses come in many sizes. In this table, the size specifies the compute resources per cluster available to the warehouse.
Each increase in size to the next larger warehouse approximately doubles the computing power and the number of credits billed per
full hour that the warehouse runs.

For information on credit consumption, see the [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf).

Important

Warehouses are only billed for credit usage while running. When a warehouse is suspended, it does not use any credits.

The credit numbers shown above are for a full hour of usage; however, credits are billed per-second, with a 60-second (i.e. 1-minute)
minimum:

- Each time a warehouse is started or resumed, the warehouse is billed for 1 minute’s worth of usage based on the hourly
  rate shown above.
- Each time a warehouse is resized to a larger size, the warehouse is billed for 1 minute’s worth of usage; however, the number
  of credits billed are only for the additional compute resources that are provisioned. For example, resizing from Small
  (2 credits/hour) to Medium (4 credits/hour) results in billing charges for 1 minute’s worth of 2 additional credits.
- After 1 minute, all subsequent billing is per-second as long as the warehouse runs continuously.
- Suspending and then resuming a warehouse within the first minute results in multiple charges because the 1-minute minimum starts
  over each time a warehouse is resumed.
- Resizing a warehouse from 5X-Large or 6X-Large to 4X-Large (or smaller) results in a brief period during which the warehouse is
  billed for both the new compute resources and the old resources while the old resources are quiesced.

For more information on warehouses in general, see [Overview of warehouses](/user-guide/warehouses-overview) and [Warehouse considerations](/user-guide/warehouses-considerations).

To learn how to view the historical cost of consuming compute resources with virtual warehouses, see [Exploring compute cost](/user-guide/cost-exploring-compute).

## Serverless credit usage

Serverless credit usage is the result of features relying on compute resources provided by Snowflake rather than user-managed
virtual warehouses. These compute resources are automatically resized and scaled up or down by Snowflake as required for each workload.

For these serverless features, which usually require continuous and/or maintenance operations, this model is more efficient, allowing
Snowflake to charge based on the time spent using the resources. In contrast, user-managed virtual warehouses consume credits while running,
regardless of whether they are performing any work, which may cause them to be overutilized or sit idle.

Charges for serverless features are calculated based on total usage of snowflake-managed compute resources measured in *compute-hours*.
Compute-Hours are calculated on a per second basis, rounded up to the nearest whole second. The number of credits consumed per compute
hour varies depending on the serverless feature.

To learn how many credits are consumed by a serverless feature, refer to the “Serverless Feature Credit Table” in the
[Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf).

Charges for the use of a serverless feature appear on your bill as an individual line item. Charges for both Snowflake-managed compute
resources and Cloud Services appear as a single line item for that serverless feature.

To learn how to view the historical cost of using serverless compute resources, see [Exploring compute cost](/user-guide/cost-exploring-compute).

## Compute pool credit usage

[Snowpark Container Services](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) uses compute pools to run its jobs and services.
A compute pool is a collection of one or more virtual machine (VM) nodes. The number and type of these nodes determine how many credits the
job or service consumes as it uses the compute pool.

For more information about the cost of compute pools, including how to monitor these costs, see [Compute pool cost](/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views#label-compute-pool-cost).

## Cloud service credit usage

The cloud services layer of the Snowflake architecture is a collection of services that coordinate activities across Snowflake.
This layer authenticates users, enforces security, performs query compilation and optimization, handles request query caching, and more.
Cloud services tie together all of the different components of Snowflake, including supporting the use of virtual warehouses.

The cloud services layer is constructed of stateless compute resources, running across multiple availability zones and using a highly
available, distributed metadata store for global state management. The cloud services layer runs on compute instances provisioned by
Snowflake from the cloud provider.

Similar to virtual warehouse usage, [Snowflake credits](#label-what-are-credits) are used to pay for the usage of the cloud
services.

Snowflake Marketplace calculates compute costs for listing auto-fulfillment to VPS regions by using VPS rates. For details on VPS rates, see [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf).

### Understanding billing for cloud services usage

Usage for cloud services is charged only if the daily consumption of cloud services exceeds 10% of the daily usage of virtual warehouses.
The charge is calculated daily (in the UTC time zone). This ensures that the 10% adjustment is accurately applied each day, at the credit
price for that day.

Keep the following in mind:

- Serverless compute does not factor into the 10% adjustment for cloud services.
- The 10% adjustment for cloud services is calculated daily (in the UTC time zone) by multiplying daily warehouse usage by 10%.
- The adjustment on the monthly usage statement is equal to the sum of these daily calculations.
- If cloud services consumption is less than 10% of warehouse compute credits on a given day, then the adjustment for that day is equal to
  the cloud services used by your account. The daily adjustment never exceeds actual cloud services usage for that day. Thus, the total
  monthly adjustment may be significantly less than 10%.

For example:

  includes [sample queries](/user-guide/cost-exploring-compute#label-cost-explore-query-cloud-services) you can run to see how much of cloud services consumption was
  actually billed and which queries and warehouses have the highest cloud services usage.
- To learn about patterns that drive cloud services consumption and ways that you might be able to reduce that consumption, see
  [Optimizing cloud services for cost](/user-guide/cost-optimize-cloud-services).

## What are credits?

Snowflake credits are used to pay for the consumption of resources on Snowflake. A Snowflake credit is a unit of measure, and it is
consumed only when a customer is using resources, such as when a virtual warehouse is running, the cloud services layer is performing work,
or serverless features are used.
