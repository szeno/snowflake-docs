# Troubleshooting processing of unstructured data

This topic provides instructions for resolving issues specific to processing unstructured data.

## Downloaded files cannot be opened

When attempting to open a file downloaded from a stage using a URL, you could encounter an error such as `invalid format`.

Verify that the ENCRYPTION property for the stage is configured for server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is required to access
staged files using a URL. For more information, see [Server-side encryption for unstructured data access](/user-guide/unstructured-intro#label-file-url-server-side-encryption).

For external stages, the server-side encryption setting varies by cloud storage provider. For internal stages, set the ENCRYPTION property
value to `SNOWFLAKE_SSE`.

The encryption type is specified when creating a stage (using [CREATE STAGE](/sql-reference/sql/create-stage)) or later
(using [ALTER STAGE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-stage)).
