# Tutorial 3: Build a PDF chatbot with Cortex Search

## Introduction

This tutorial describes how to build a chatbot from a dataset of PDF documents
using Cortex Search. In [Tutorial 2](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/tutorials/cortex-search-tutorial-2-chat),
you learned how to build a chatbot from text data that was already extracted from its source.
This tutorial walks through an example of extracting that text from the PDFs using a basic Python
UDF, then ingesting the extracted data into a Cortex Search Service.

### What you will learn

- Extract text from a set of PDF files in a stage using a Python UDF.
- Create a Cortex Search Service from the extracted text.
- Create a Streamlit-in-Snowflake chat app that lets you ask questions about the
  data extracted from the PDF documents.

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to complete this tutorial:

- You have a Snowflake account and user with a role that grants the necessary
  privileges to create a database, tables, virtual warehouse objects, Cortex Search Services, and Streamlit apps.

Refer to the [Snowflake in 20 minutes](/user-guide/tutorials/snowflake-in-20minutes) for instructions to meet these requirements.

## Step 1: Setup

### Get the PDF data

You will use a sample dataset of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes for this tutorial.
This is a sample of twelve 10-page documents with meeting notes from FOMC meetings from 2023 and 2024.
Download the files directly from your browser by following this link:

- [FOMC minutes sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C6TdVjy6d-GnasGO6ZrIEVJQRcedDQxG/view?usp=sharing)

The complete set of FOMC minutes can be found at the
[US Federal Reserve’s website](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm).

Note

In a non-tutorial setting, you would bring your own data, possibly already in a Snowflake stage.

### Create the database, tables, and warehouse

Execute the following statements to create a database and a virtual warehouse needed for this tutorial.
After you complete the tutorial, you can drop these objects.

Copy code

```
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cortex_search_tutorial_db;

CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE cortex_search_tutorial_wh WITH
     WAREHOUSE_SIZE='X-SMALL'
     AUTO_SUSPEND = 120
     AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
     INITIALLY_SUSPENDED=TRUE;

 USE WAREHOUSE cortex_search_tutorial_wh;
```

Note

- The `CREATE DATABASE` statement creates a database. The database automatically includes a schema named PUBLIC.
- The `CREATE WAREHOUSE` statement creates an initially suspended warehouse.

## Step 2: Load the data into Snowflake

First create a Snowflake stage to store the files that contain the data. This stage will hold the meeting minutes PDF files.

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE cortex_search_tutorial_db.public.fomc
    DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE)
    ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');
```

Note

The directory and encryption are configured for generating presigned\_url for a file. If you don’t need to generate presigned\_url,
you can skip these configurations.

Now upload the dataset. You can upload the dataset in Snowsight or using SQL. To upload in Snowsight:

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Catalog** » **Explorer**.
3. Select your database `cortex_search_tutorial_db`.
4. Select your schema `public`.
5. Select **Stages** and select `fomc`.
6. On the top right, Select the **+ Files** button.
7. Drag and drop files into the UI or select **Browse** to choose a file from the dialog window.
8. Select **Upload** to upload your file.

## Step 3: Parse PDF files

In this step, we’ll extract raw text from PDFs and then split it up into chunks for ingestion into the
search service.

First, we will use the [Parsing documents with AI\_PARSE\_DOCUMENT](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/parse-document) function to extract the text and layout
information from the PDFs into a new table, `RAW_TEXT`.

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE cortex_search_tutorial_db.public.raw_text AS
SELECT
    RELATIVE_PATH,
    TO_VARCHAR (
        AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT (
            TO_FILE('@cortex_search_tutorial_db.public.fomc', RELATIVE_PATH),
            {'mode': 'LAYOUT'} ):content
        ) AS EXTRACTED_LAYOUT
FROM
    DIRECTORY('@cortex_search_tutorial_db.public.fomc')
WHERE
    RELATIVE_PATH LIKE '%.pdf';
```

Then, we will use [SPLIT\_TEXT\_MARKDOWN\_HEADER](/sql-reference/functions/split_text_markdown_header-snowflake-cortex) to
split the documents up into chunks of maximum size 2000 characters each, using the top two markdown header levels as chunk boundaries.
We’ll insert the chunks into a new table `DOC_CHUNKS`.

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE cortex_search_tutorial_db.public.doc_chunks AS
SELECT
    relative_path,
    BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL(@cortex_search_tutorial_db.public.fomc, relative_path) AS file_url,
    (
        relative_path || ':\n'
        || coalesce('Header 1: ' || c.value['headers']['header_1'] || '\n', '')
        || coalesce('Header 2: ' || c.value['headers']['header_2'] || '\n', '')
        || c.value['chunk']
    ) AS chunk,
    'English' AS language
FROM
    cortex_search_tutorial_db.public.raw_text,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SPLIT_TEXT_MARKDOWN_HEADER(
        EXTRACTED_LAYOUT,
        OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('#', 'header_1', '##', 'header_2'),
        2000, -- chunks of 2000 characters
        300 -- 300 character overlap
    )) c;
```

## Step 4: Create search service

Create a search service over your new table by running the following SQL command:

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE cortex_search_tutorial_db.public.fomc_meeting
    ON chunk
    ATTRIBUTES language
    WAREHOUSE = cortex_search_tutorial_wh
    TARGET_LAG = '1 hour'
    AS (
    SELECT
        chunk,
        relative_path,
        file_url,
        language
    FROM cortex_search_tutorial_db.public.doc_chunks
    );
```

This command specifies the `attributes`, which are the columns that you’ll be able to filter search results on, as well as the
warehouse and target lag. The search column is designated as `chunk`, which is generated in the source query as a
concatenation of several text columns in the base table. The other columns in the source query can be included in response to a search request.

## Step 5: Create a Streamlit app

You can query the service with Python SDK (using the `snowflake` Python package). This tutorial
demonstrates using the Python SDK in a Streamlit in Snowflake application.

First, ensure your global Snowsight UI role is the same as the role used to create
the service in the service creation step.

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. In the navigation menu, select **Projects** » **Streamlit**.
3. Select **+ Streamlit App**.
4. **Important**: Select the `cortex_search_tutorial_db` database and the `public` schema for the app location.
5. In the left pane of the Streamlit in Snowflake editor, select **Packages** and add `snowflake` (version >= 0.8.0) and `snowflake-ml-python` to install the required packages in your
   application.
6. Replace the example application code with the following Streamlit app:

   Copy code

   ```
   import streamlit as st
   from snowflake.core import Root # requires snowflake>=0.8.0
   from snowflake.cortex import Complete

## Step 6: Try out the app

In the right pane of the Streamlit in Snowflake editor window, you’ll see a preview of your Streamlit app. It should look similar to the following
screenshot:

![Chat with PDF files in Streamlit UI](/static/images/cortex-search/pdf_chatbot_tutorial_streamlit_query_2.png)

Enter a query in the text box to try out your new app. Some sample queries you can try are:

- Example session 1: multi-turn question-answering
  :   - `How was gdp growth in q4 23?`
      - `How was unemployment in the same quarter?`
- Example session 2: summarizing multiple documents
  :   - `How has the fed's view of the market change over the course of 2024?`
- Example session 3: abstaining when the documents don’t contain the right answer
  :   - `What was janet yellen's opinion about 2024 q1?`

## Step 7: Clean up

### Clean up (optional)

Execute the following [DROP <object>](/sql-reference/sql/drop) commands to return your system to its state before you began the tutorial:

Copy code

```
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS cortex_search_tutorial_db;
DROP WAREHOUSE IF EXISTS cortex_search_tutorial_wh;
```

Dropping the database automatically removes all child database objects such as tables.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have successfully built a search app from a set of PDF files in Snowflake.
