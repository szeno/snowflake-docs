# Using Snowflake Copilot

Important

Snowflake Copilot is being replaced with Cortex Code. To learn more about Cortex Code, see [Cortex Code in Snowsight](/user-guide/cortex-code/cortex-code-snowsight).

This topic provides an introduction to what Snowflake Copilot is and how to use it in your data analysis workflow. This topic gives information about how to use Snowflake Copilot with a chat interface. For information about using Snowflake Copilot inline, see [Using Snowflake Copilot inline](/user-guide/snowflake-copilot-inline).
The examples in this topic use worksheets.

Note

Snowflake Copilot is natively supported in the following regions:

- AWS US West 2 (Oregon)
- AWS US East 1 (N. Virginia)
- AWS US East (Commercial Gov - N. Virginia)
- AWS Europe Central 1 (Frankfurt)
- AWS AP Northeast 1 (Tokyo)
- AWS Europe West 1 (Ireland)
- AWS AP Southeast 2 (Sydney)
- Azure East US 2 (Virginia)
- Azure West Europe (Netherlands)

To use Snowflake Copilot in other regions, set the `CORTEX_ENABLED_CROSS_REGION` parameter.
Within this parameter, you can either:

- Provide a list of values that include at least one of the supported regions.
- Set it to `ANY_REGION`.

For information about how to use the `CORTEX_ENABLED_CROSS_REGION` parameter, see [Choosing a routing option](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cross-region-inference#label-use-cross-region-inference).

## Introduction

Snowflake Copilot is an LLM-powered assistant that simplifies data analysis while maintaining robust data governance, and seamlessly integrates
into your existing Snowflake workflow.

Snowflake Copilot is powered by a model fine-tuned by Snowflake that runs securely inside [Snowflake Cortex](/guides-overview-ai-features),
Snowflake’s intelligent, fully managed AI service. This approach means that your enterprise data and metadata always stay securely inside
Snowflake. Snowflake Copilot also fully respects RBAC and provides suggestions based only on the datasets that you can access.

Snowflake Copilot uses natural language requests to enable data analysis from start to finish. To start, Copilot can help answer questions
about how your data is structured and guide you in exploring a new dataset. You can then ask Copilot to generate and refine SQL queries to
extract useful information from your data. Snowflake Copilot can even help improve your SQL query by recommending optimizations or suggesting
fixes for possible issues.

Snowflake Copilot can also help improve your SQL fluency or understanding of Snowflake features. Ask questions about how to perform a task in
Snowflake and Copilot will return answers based on the Snowflake documentation.

You can interact with Copilot in SQL Worksheets in Snowsight. Using the Copilot panel, you can enter a question,
and Snowflake Copilot will reply with an answer. You can run suggested SQL queries in your worksheet.

## Access control requirements

The COPILOT\_USER database role in the SNOWFLAKE database includes the privileges that allow users to use Snowflake Copilot features. By default,
the COPILOT\_USER role is granted to the PUBLIC role. The PUBLIC role is automatically granted
to all users and roles, so this allows all users in your account to use Snowflake Copilot features.

Users with this privilege will see **Ask Copilot** in the lower-right corner of their worksheet and can use the panel
to interact with Snowflake Copilot.

## Limit access to Copilot

If you don’t want all users to have access to Copilot, you can revoke the COPILOT\_USER database role from the PUBLIC role and grant access to specific roles.

To revoke the COPILOT\_USER database role from the PUBLIC role, run the following command using the ACCOUNTADMIN role:

Copy code

```
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

REVOKE DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.COPILOT_USER
  FROM ROLE PUBLIC;
```

A user without this role will not see **Ask Copilot** in the lower-right corner of their worksheet. You can switch your
active role in the navigation menu on the left to switch to a role that has access to Copilot to see the **Ask Copilot** menu again.
For details, see [Switch your primary role](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-switching-your-active-role).

You can then selectively provide access to specific roles. The SNOWFLAKE.COPILOT\_USER database role cannot be granted directly to a user.
For more information, see [Using SNOWFLAKE database roles](/sql-reference/snowflake-db-roles#label-using-snowflake-db-roles). A user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can grant this role to a custom role
in order to allow users to access Snowflake Copilot features. In the following example, use the ACCOUNTADMIN role and grant the user
`some_user` the COPILOT\_USER database role via the account role `copilot_access_role`, which you create for this purpose.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

CREATE ROLE copilot_access_role;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.COPILOT_USER TO ROLE copilot_access_role;

GRANT ROLE copilot_access_role TO USER some_user;
```

You can also grant access to Snowflake Copilot through existing roles commonly used by specific groups of
users. (See [User roles](/user-guide/admin-user-management#label-user-management-user-roles).) For example, if you have created an `analyst` role that is used
as a default role by analysts in your organization, you can easily grant these users access to Snowflake Copilot
with a single GRANT statement.

Copy code

```
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.COPILOT_USER TO ROLE analyst;
```

### Limit models used by Snowflake Copilot

Role-based access control (RBAC) at the model level lets account administrators control which large language models (LLMs) can be used by Snowflake Copilot and other Cortex features based on user roles. Access to each LLM is controlled using a distinct application role. Organizations with regulatory or compliance restrictions might need to control the use of some LLMs, especially those hosted outside of their cloud boundary.

Important

Role-based access control (RBAC) at the model level is intended for customers with strict legal or compliance requirements. Enabling this feature might cause Snowflake Copilot and other features that rely on models to stop working because required models are not accessible. Limiting access to a model impacts any Snowflake Cortex feature that relies on that model.

We recommend not using RBAC at the model level unless absolutely necessary.

#### Snowflake Copilot model selection

Snowflake Copilot uses the following logic to select a model to use when model level RBAC is enabled.

1. Snowflake Copilot uses Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5 if the user is in AWS US West, AWS US East, or has cross-region inference enabled.
2. If Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5 is not available because of RBAC or region availability, Snowflake Copilot uses Mistral Large 2.
3. If Mistral Large 2 is also not available, Snowflake Copilot does not appear in the Snowsight UI and any requests to the Snowflake Copilot API fail.

#### Enable and configure model level RBAC

Complete the following steps to enable model level RBAC and configure the models that Snowflake Copilot can use.

1. Grant model-specific application roles to user roles. The user only then has access to these models when using Snowflake Copilot. Each supported LLM has a corresponding application role. For information about granting these application roles to implement model level RBAC, see [Role-based access control (RBAC)](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/aisql-privileges-and-access#label-cortex-llm-rbac).
2. Snowflake Copilot automatically selects the best available model based on access privileges and regional availability.

#### Risks and limitations

Snowflake Copilot needs access to at least one model to function. Limiting access to specific models eliminates fallback options and increases the risk of partial or total failure. If you remove access to all models using RBAC, Snowflake Copilot might become unusable. Snowflake is not responsible for Snowflake Copilot availability in those circumstances. Limiting access to models also applies to all Cortex features that might use that model.

## Supported use cases

- **Explore your data** by asking open-ended questions to learn about the structure and nuances of a new dataset.
- **Generate SQL queries** with questions in plain English.
- **Try out the SQL query** suggested by Snowflake Copilot with the click of a button. You can also edit the query
  before running it.
- **Build complex queries** through a conversation with Snowflake Copilot by asking follow-up questions to refine the suggested SQL query and
  dig deeper into the analysis.
- **Learn about Snowflake** by asking questions about Snowflake concepts, capabilities, and features.
- **Improve your queries** by asking Snowflake Copilot to help you assess query efficiency, find optimizations, or explain what the query does.
- **Provide feedback** (thumbs up or thumbs down) on each response from Snowflake Copilot, which will be used to improve the product.
- **Add custom instructions** such as a set of preferences or specific business knowledge for Snowflake Copilot to consider
  when generating responses.

## Limitations

- **Support for the following languages:**

  - English
  - French
  - German
  - Spanish
  - Italian
  - Portuguese
  - Arabic
  - Hindi
  - Chinese
  - Japanese
  - Korean
  - SQL
  - Python
  - Java
- **No access to your data:** Snowflake Copilot does not have access to the data inside your tables. If you want to
  filter on a particular value of a column, you should provide that value. For example, if you ask Snowflake Copilot to return all rows with a
  column A value equal to “X”, you should provide the value “X” in your request. See the
  [Construct and run a SQL Statement](#label-snowflake-copilot-construct-sql-example) example.
- **Snowflake Copilot does not support cross database or schema queries:** You can work around this by creating and using views that join data from
  different schemas and databases.
- **Delayed response:** Snowflake Copilot might take a second to complete a response, depending on the length of the response provided.
- **SQL suggestions may not always work:** Snowflake Copilot may sometimes suggest queries that contain invalid SQL syntax or non-existent
  tables or columns. Please provide feedback using the thumbs up or thumbs down buttons for the particular response. This feedback helps us
  improve this feature.
- **Delay in detecting new databases, schemas, and tables:** It may take up to 3-4 hours for Snowflake Copilot to recognize newly created
  databases, schemas, and tables.
- **Limited number of tables and columns considered:** To generate a response, Snowflake Copilot first searches for
  tables and columns most relevant for your request. The search results are then ranked by relevancy and only the top 10 tables and top
  10 columns from each of those tables in the results are considered when generating a response.

## How to use Snowflake Copilot

Snowflake Copilot is ready to use with no additional setup. Remember the following points when using Snowflake Copilot:

- Each chat session with Snowflake Copilot is associated with a particular worksheet. Opening a new worksheet opens a
  new chat session.
- You must have a database and schema in use during your session to use Snowflake Copilot. Copilot uses them to generate relevant responses.
- Snowflake Copilot uses the names of your databases, schemas, tables, and columns and also the data types of your columns to determine what
  data is available to query.
- If Snowflake Copilot cannot answer your question based on the selected database and schema, it may try to use other ways to answer, such
  as the Snowflake documentation or general SQL knowledge. If you get an unexpected response, you can leave feedback using the
  thumbs up and thumbs down buttons.
- If you need to refer to a table name or a column name in your question, prefix the name with `@`. Referring to specific tables
  and columns can help Snowflake Copilot provide more accurate responses.
- For optimal performance, use meaningful names for databases, schemas, tables, and columns, and ensure that columns are assigned the
  appropriate data type.

Follow these steps to start using Snowflake Copilot:

1. Create a new worksheet or open an existing worksheet.
2. Select **Ask Copilot** in the lower-right corner of the worksheet.
   The Snowflake Copilot panel opens on the right side of the worksheet.
3. Make sure a database and a schema are selected for the current worksheet. If not, you can select them by using either
   the selector on the top of the worksheet or the selector below the Snowflake Copilot message box.
4. In the message box, type in your question and then select the send icon or press `Enter` to submit it. Snowflake Copilot provides a
   response in the panel.
5. If the response from Snowflake Copilot includes SQL statements:
   - Select **Run** to run the query. This adds the query to your worksheet and runs it.
   - Select **Add** to edit the query before running it. This adds the query to your worksheet.

## Add custom instructions

Snowflake Copilot accepts custom instructions that let you customize how it responds. When enabled,
these instructions are used to enhance the prompt that’s sent to the model behind Snowflake Copilot and are considered by
Copilot when it’s generating new responses. Custom instructions can include directions to use a specific tone or respond in a certain way,
preferences on how to write SQL, or additional information about the data to consider.

Remember the following when adding custom instructions:

- There is a 2,000 character limit for custom instructions.
- Snowflake recommends specifying custom instructions in plain English.
- The instructions are specific to the user that entered them and used for all their conversations with Snowflake Copilot.

Follow these steps to add custom instructions for Snowflake Copilot:

1. Create a new worksheet or open an existing worksheet.
2. Select **Ask Copilot** in the lower-right corner of the worksheet.
   The Snowflake Copilot panel opens on the right side of the worksheet.
3. Select the **Copilot** menu at the top of the Snowflake Copilot panel.
4. Select **Custom instructions** from the drop-down menu.
5. To enable the custom instructions text box, select the **Enable for new chats** toggle on the bottom left of the custom
   instructions window.
6. Enter your instructions in plain text English.
7. Select **Save** when finished.
8. Continue your conversation with Snowflake Copilot in the Copilot panel.

## Examples

The following sections provide examples that demonstrate how to:

- [Explore your data](#label-snowflake-copilot-eda-example)

- [Get an explanation of a SQL statement](#label-snowflake-copilot-explain-sql-example)
- [Ask questions about SQL and Snowflake concepts](#label-snowflake-copilot-general-questions-example)

These examples use a sample dataset from the Snowflake Marketplace.

### Prerequisites

The examples in this section use the [Cybersyn Github Archive dataset](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZAS2KJ3/cybersyn-inc-cybersyn-github-archive) from the Snowflake Marketplace:

1. Install the [Cybersyn Github Archive dataset](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZAS2KJ3/cybersyn-inc-cybersyn-github-archive) in your account.
2. Create a new worksheet or open an existing worksheet.
3. Select **Ask Copilot** in the lower-right corner of the worksheet.
4. Select the Cybersyn Github Archive database and schema.

### Explore your data

The following example demonstrates how to use Snowflake Copilot to explore a dataset.

1. Enter an open-ended question such as “What types of questions can I ask about this dataset?”
2. Press `Enter` and Snowflake Copilot will generate a response based on the database and schema you’ve selected.
3. Ask further clarifying questions about the data, such as “What type of events can I filter by?”
   or “Are any of these tables joinable?”
4. If the response from Snowflake Copilot includes a SQL statement, you can select **Add** to add the query to the end of your
   worksheet and edit it before running or select **Run** to add the query and run it automatically.

### Construct and run a SQL Statement

The following example demonstrates how to use Snowflake Copilot to generate SQL queries.

1. Enter the question “How many stars were given in the past year?” in the Snowflake Copilot message box, and press `Enter`. Snowflake Copilot
   responds with a SQL query that answers your question.
2. Select **Add** to add the query to the end of your worksheet.
3. Enter the question “Show me this for each month,” and press `Enter`. Snowflake Copilot responds with a SQL query
   that answers your question.
4. Select **Run** to add the query to your worksheet and run the query.

Snowflake Copilot does not have access to the data inside your tables. If you want Snowflake Copilot to construct a
SQL statement that filters based on a specific value of a column, you must provide the value
to filter on.

1. Enter the question “what are all the repo names that start with ‘snowflake’?” in the message box and
   press `Enter`. Snowflake Copilot responds with a SQL query that uses the filter value you provided.
2. Select **Add** to edit the query before running or select **Run** to add the query to your worksheet and run it.

### Explain a SQL statement

The following example demonstrates how to use Snowflake Copilot to explain a SQL statement you’re working on.

- In the Snowflake Copilot message box, type the following question and SQL query:

  Copy code

  ```
  Can you explain this query to me step-by-step?
  ```

  Copy code

  ```
  SELECT
    github_repos.repo_name,
    COUNT(github_stars.repo_id) AS total_stars
  FROM
    github_repos
    JOIN github_stars ON github_repos.repo_id = github_stars.repo_id
  GROUP BY
    github_repos.repo_name
  ORDER BY
    total_stars DESC;
  ```

Snowflake Copilot responds with a step-by-step explanation of the provided query.

### Ask questions about SQL and Snowflake

Snowflake Copilot has access to Snowflake documentation and can answer general questions about Snowflake or SQL. Here are some example
questions you can try:

- How do I write a SQL join?
- What is Snowpark Cortex?
- How do I ingest data into Snowflake?

## Tips for using Snowflake Copilot

- Creating curated [views](/user-guide/views-introduction) can significantly improve the performance of Snowflake Copilot.

  Follow these guidelines when creating the views:

  | Guideline | Example |
  | --- | --- |
  | Use descriptive and easy-to-understand names for the views and their columns.  When choosing the names, use the business and data taxonomy you are likely to use while using Snowflake Copilot. | If a column contains the date for a specific sale, name the column `sale_date`. |
  | Make sure all columns have the appropriate data type. | If a column contains the date for a specific sale, make sure it has the [DATE](/sql-reference/data-types-datetime#label-datatypes-date) type. |
  | Define commonly used metrics/expressions as new columns. | If profit is defined as `revenue - cost`, create a column `(revenue - cost) AS profit` in your view. |
  | If possible, capture common and complex joins. | If two tables `products` and `sales` are often joined, make sure that your view joins these tables.  If there are multiple join paths between commonly joined tables, use the preferred join path in your view. |

- Be as specific as possible when you ask a question. Imagine that you are asking a question to a human who may have limited knowledge
  of your data.
- If you want to filter on specific values inside columns, you might need to actively guide Snowflake Copilot. You can ask Snowflake Copilot for a
  query that returns all the distinct values in a column.
