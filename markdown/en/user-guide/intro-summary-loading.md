# Summary of data loading features

This topic provides a quick-reference of the supported features for using the [COPY INTO <table>](/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table) command to load data from files
into Snowflake tables.

## Data file details

The following table describes the general details for the files used to load data:

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Location of files | Local environment | Files are first copied (“staged”) to an internal (Snowflake) stage, then loaded into a table. |
|  | Amazon S3 | Files can be loaded directly from any user-supplied bucket. |
|  | Google Cloud Storage | Files can be loaded directly from any user-supplied bucket. |
|  | Microsoft Azure cloud storage   - Blob storage - Data Lake Storage Gen2 - General-purpose v1 - General-purpose v2 | Files can be loaded directly from any user-supplied container. |
| File formats | Delimited files (CSV, TSV, etc.) | Any valid delimiter is supported; default is comma (that is, CSV). |
|  | [Semi-structured formats](/user-guide/semistructured-intro)   - JSON - Avro - ORC - Parquet - XML |  |
|  | [Unstructured formats](/user-guide/unstructured-intro) |  |
| File encoding | File format-specific | For delimited files (CSV, TSV, etc.), the default character set is UTF-8. To use any other character sets, you must explicitly specify the encoding to use for loading. For the list of supported character sets, see [Supported Character Sets for Delimited Files](#supported-character-sets-for-delimited-files) (in this topic). |
|  |  | For semi-structured file formats (JSON, Avro, etc.), the only supported character set is UTF-8. |
|  |  | Snowflake doesn’t support loading data from tar (tape archive) files. |

## Compression of staged files

The following table describes how Snowflake handles compression of data files for loading. The options are different depending on whether the files are staged, uncompressed, or already-compressed:

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Uncompressed files | gzip | When staging uncompressed files in a Snowflake stage, the files are automatically compressed using gzip, unless compression is explicitly disabled. |
| Already-compressed files | - gzip - bzip2 - deflate - raw\_deflate - Brotli - Zstandard | Snowflake can automatically detect any of these compression methods, or you can explicitly specify the method that was used to compress the files.  Auto-detection isn’t supported for Brotli-compressed files; when staging or loading Brotli-compressed files, you must explicitly specify the compression method that was used.  Snowflake doesn’t support uploading compressed tar (tape archive) files. |

## Encryption of staged files

The following table describes how Snowflake handles encryption of data files for loading. The options are different depending on whether the files are staged
unencrypted or already-encrypted:

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unencrypted files | 128-bit or 256-bit keys | All files stored on internal stages for data loading and unloading operations are automatically encrypted using AES-256 strong encryption on the server side. By default, Snowflake provides additional client-side encryption with a 128-bit key (with the option to configure a 256-bit key). |
| Already-encrypted files | User-supplied key | Files that are already encrypted can be loaded into Snowflake from external cloud storage; the key used to encrypt the files must be provided to Snowflake. |
