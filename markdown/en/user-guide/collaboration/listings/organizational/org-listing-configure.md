# Configure organizational listings

This page introduces configurations for organizational listings in Snowflake. You’ll find details on targeting accounts, adding roles, access regions, and auto-fulfillment settings.

## Set the Uniform Listing Locator or listing name

The Uniform Listing Locator (ULL) is a unique identifier that represents the listing and its data product, treating them as one.
The listing name is different from the title of the listing: multiple listings can have the same title, but each listing must have
a unique listing name or ULL. The complete ULL is formed by three elements delimited by the symbol ‘$’.
The first element is the provider’s organization name, the second element is the provider profile
`INTERNAL`, and the third element is the listing name. The ULL cannot be changed after the listing is published.
Although it has three parts, the ULL is treated as a single name in queries. For example, you can query a table in a listing like this:

Copy code

```
SELECT * FROM "ORGDATACLOUD$INTERNAL$MY_LISTING_NAME_123".PUBLIC.TABLE_FROM_LISTING;
```

When creating a listing, give it a clear, descriptive name. Consumers can find listings faster by name rather than title,
and a descriptive name is easier to use in queries.

## Set who can discover and access an organizational listing

The target audience of your organizational listings is always your internal marketplace.

Despite the restrictions of an internal listing, you can still control who can discover and access the listing.
You can mark each listing discoverable and accessible individually. That is, you can configure a listing so that it is discoverable but not accessible.

In general you can specify access or discovery at the following levels:

- Everyone in your account
- Specific accounts
- Specific accounts, but limited by specific roles

For example the `access` element defines who can access a listing.
Likewise, the `discovery` element defines who can discover a listing.

Allow all accounts to access the listing.

Copy code

```
organization_targets:
   access:
   - all_accounts : true
```

Allow specific accounts to access the listing.

Copy code

```
organization_targets:
   access:
   - account: 'Account1'
   - account: 'Account2'
```

Allow specific accounts to access the listing, but only for the given roles.

Copy code

```
organization_targets:
   access:
      - account: 'Account1'
         roles: [<role1>, <role2>, <role3>]
```

Allow all accounts to discover the listing.

Copy code

```
organization_targets:
   discovery:
   - all_accounts : true
```

Allow specific accounts to discover the listing.

Copy code

```
organization_targets:
   discovery:
   - account: 'Account1'
   - account: 'Account2'
```

Allow specific accounts to discover the listing, but only for the given roles.

Copy code

```
organization_targets:
   discovery:
      - account: 'Account1'
         roles: [<role1>, <role2>, <role3>]
```

In a similar way, regions are set up the access regions\_attribute:

Copy code

```
locations:
  access_regions:
     - name: "ALL"
```

Copy code

```
locations:
   access_regions:
     - name: "AWS_US_WEST_2"
     - name: "AZURE_CENTRALINDIAUS-EAST"
```

## Specify approver and support contact

Optionally, you can specify an email address or link to internal ticketing system for both approver and support contact.

Copy code

```
support_contact: "support@somedomain.com"
approver_contact: "approver@somedomain.com"
```

## Set auto-fulfillment options for an organizational listing

Organizational listings that have attached data shares and apps both use auto-fulfillment, however they each
use different methods. For this reason, the refresh schedules for each are different. For shares, the refresh
schedule is set on the database level. For apps, it’s set on the account level.

If you need to use auto-fulfillment, you can set it when your run `CREATE ORGANIZATIONAL LISTING` OR
`ALTER LISTING` by changing the auto\_fulfillment attribute in the [listing manifest fields](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-listing#parameters).

Copy code

```
auto_fulfillment:
   refresh_type: SUB_DATABASE
   refresh_schedule: '10 MINUTE'
```
