# Tutorial: Create and manage an organizational listing

Organizational listings in Snowflake allow you to share data products securely within your organization, making it easier
for internal teams to discover and use trusted resources. As a provider, you can create listings that centralize access
to datasets, Native Apps, and other resources, simplifying data sharing and collaboration across your teams. This guide
will help you understand the steps and requirements to create and manage organizational listings effectively, ensuring
that your data products are accessible while maintaining control over who can see and use them.

Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary privileges to create and manage organizational listings.

In this tutorial, we create a custom role (ORG\_LISTING\_PROVIDER) to manage listings on behalf of the organization.

## Create a role to manage organizational listings

Switch to the ORGADMIN role (or ACCOUNTADMIN) to create a new role and add one or more users. These users will be the administrators
for organizational listings. Then GRANT the new role the required privileges to create and share organizational listings.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
CREATE ROLE ORG_LISTING_PROVIDER;
GRANT ROLE ORG_LISTING_PROVIDER TO USER <user_name>;
GRANT CREATE SHARE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE ORG_LISTING_PROVIDER;
GRANT CREATE ORGANIZATION LISTING ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE ORG_LISTING_PROVIDER;
```

## Create a share and grant usage to it

Switch to the ORG\_LISTING\_PROVIDER custom role that you just created to create a share and grant usage to the share.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE ORG_LISTING_PROVIDER;
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE DEVORGDB;
USE DATABASE DEVORGDB;
CREATE SHARE ORG_SHARE SECURE_OBJECTS_ONLY=FALSE;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE DEVORGDB TO SHARE ORG_SHARE;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA PUBLIC TO SHARE ORG_SHARE;
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE TUTORIAL_TABLE ( item_id INT, item_name STRING );
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE DEVORGDB.PUBLIC.TUTORIAL_TABLE TO SHARE ORG_SHARE;
INSERT INTO TUTORIAL_TABLE (item_id, item_name) VALUES (1,'Tutorial table');
```

## Create an organizational listing

Create an organizational listings from the share with the required attributes included
in YAML (entered in $$ delimiters).

This example shares the listing with all accounts in the organization:

Copy code

```
USE ROLE ORG_LISTING_PROVIDER;
CREATE ORGANIZATION LISTING ORG_LISTING
SHARE ORG_SHARE AS
$$
title : "My title"
organization_profile: INTERNAL
organization_targets:
    access:
    - all_accounts : true 
locations:
  access_regions:
  - name: "ALL"
auto_fulfillment:
  refresh_type: "SUB_DATABASE"
  refresh_schedule: "10 MINUTE"
$$;
```

For a complete list of all fields and values for an Organization listing see [Organization listing manifest reference](/user-guide/collaboration/listings/organizational/org-listing-manifest-reference).

## Alter an organizational listing

Alter the organizational listings by including any changes or additional attributes in the YAML.

Caution

When altering an organizational listing you must include all the attributes from the original listing manifest.
Failure to include all attributes can cause errors or the unexpected removal of existing attributes from the listing manifest.
Snowflake recommends capturing the existing listing manifest with the [DESCRIBE LISTING](/sql-reference/sql/desc-listing) command and then using the results as the input in the [ALTER LISTING](/sql-reference/sql/alter-listing) command.

This example shares the listing with a single account and adds a description to the listing:

Copy code

```
USE ROLE ORG_LISTING_PROVIDER;
ALTER LISTING ORG_LISTING
AS
$$
title : "My title"
organization_profile: INTERNAL
organization_targets:
    access:
    - all_accounts : false 
locations:
  access_regions:
  - name: "ALL"
auto_fulfillment:
  refresh_type: "SUB_DATABASE"
  refresh_schedule: "10 MINUTE"
$$;
```

## View a list of organizational listings

To view organizational listings, run the following command:

Copy code

```
SHOW LISTINGS;
DESCRIBE LISTING ORG_LISTING;
```

## (Optional) Add auto-fulfillment for organizational listings

To enable auto-fulfillment for your organizational listings, run the following commands:

Important

Before you run the command to enable auto-fulfillment, check to see if it’s already enabled and note the current settings.
If it’s already turned on, you don’t need to run the command.

Copy code

```
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
GRANT MANAGE LISTING AUTO FULFILLMENT ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE ORG_LISTING_PROVIDER;

USE ROLE ORG_LISTING_PROVIDER;
SHOW ORGANIZATION ACCOUNTS;
SELECT SYSTEM$IS_GLOBAL_DATA_SHARING_ENABLED_FOR_ACCOUNT('<ORGACCOUNT>');

CALL SYSTEM$ENABLE_GLOBAL_DATA_SHARING_FOR_ACCOUNT('<ORGACCOUNT>');
```

## Clean up after the tutorial

To drop any unwanted objects you created during this tutorial, run one or more of the
following commands as needed:

Important

If auto-fulfillment was enabled when you ran the last step, DO NOT disable it when you clean up after the query.
Doing so will stop all auto-fulfillment on your account!

Copy code

```
DROP LISTING <organizational_listing_name>;
DROP SHARE org_listing1_share1;
DROP DATABASE org_listing_db1;
--CALL SYSTEM$DISABLE_GLOBAL_DATA_SHARING_FOR_ACCOUNT('ORGACCOUNT');
DROP ROLE ORG_LISTING_PROVIDER;
```
