# Data sharing and collaboration in Snowflake

There are many ways to share data from your Snowflake account with users in other Snowflake accounts, including collaborating with other
parties in a secure environment.

## Why share data with Snowflake

When you use Snowflake to share data as a provider, you can manage who has access to your data, and avoid challenges
keeping your data synchronized across different people and groups.

As a data consumer, you can reduce the data transformations you need to perform because the data stays in Snowflake, making it easy to join
datasets shared with you with your own data.

If you share your data using listings, you can include metadata with your data share, such as a title and description, and usage examples to
help consumers use the data quickly. In addition to the benefits for consumers, as a provider you get access to usage data, automatically
replicate your data to other regions, and can even decide to charge for access to your data or offer some datasets publicly
on the Snowflake Marketplace.

## Options for sharing

Listings let you share data with people in any Snowflake region, across clouds, without performing manual replication tasks.
If you use listings, you can provide additional metadata for the data that you share, view customer data usage, and for listings
offered publicly on the Snowflake Marketplace, gauge consumer interest in your listings.

If you don’t want to share data using a listing, you can use a direct share instead, see [Secure data sharing](/user-guide/data-sharing-intro) and [Non-secure data sharing](/user-guide/data-sharing-views). No matter which option you choose, you can share with people
who don’t have Snowflake accounts by using [Reader Accounts](/user-guide/data-sharing-reader-create).

| Data Sharing Mechanism | Share With Whom? | Auto-fulfill Across Clouds? | Optionally Charge for Data? | Optionally Offer Data Publicly? | Get Consumer Usage Metrics? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Listing](#label-about-listings) | One or more accounts in any region | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [Direct share](#label-about-direct-share) | One or more accounts in your region | No | No | No | No |

If you want to manage a group of accounts, and control who can publish and consume listings in that group, consider using a [Data Exchange](#label-about-data-exchange).

## Listing

You can offer a listing privately to specific accounts, or publicly on the Snowflake Marketplace. For more about the Snowflake Marketplace, see
[About Snowflake Marketplace](/collaboration/collaboration-marketplace-about).

After you accept the provider and consumer terms, you can start sharing and consuming data shared with you with a listing.
For more information, see [About listings](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/collaboration-listings-about).

Note

To learn more about sharing listings to or from [Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS)](/user-guide/intro-editions#label-snowflake-editions-vps),
see [About collaboration in VPS environments](/collaboration/virtual-private-snowflake/about-vps-collaboration).

## Direct share

Use a direct share to share data with one or more accounts in the same Snowflake region.
You don’t need to copy or move data shared with a direct share.

If you want to convert a direct share with active consumers to a listing, see [Convert a direct share to a listing](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-creating-publishing#convert-a-direct-share-to-a-private-listing).

For more information, see [Share secure database objects](/user-guide/data-sharing-gs).

## Open Data Sharing

Open Data Sharing in Snowflake expands traditional data sharing beyond the Snowflake ecosystem.
This capability allows you to securely share live, read-only data assets with consumers who do not use Snowflake, eliminating the
need for complex ETL pipelines, data duplication, or manual file exports.

For more information, see [Open Data Sharing](/user-guide/open-data-sharing).

## Data Exchange

If creating listings that you offer privately to specific accounts isn’t an option, you can use a data exchange to share data with
a selected group of accounts that you invite.

You must request that a data exchange be provisioned and configured for your account, then you can invite members to the exchange
and specify whether they can consume data, provide data, or both.

For more information, see [About Data Exchange](/user-guide/data-exchange).

## Collaborating with shared data in a secure environment

When you use listings, direct shares, and Data Exchange to share data with another party, they can directly access the data. If you want to
share data with other parties, but want to control how that data is accessed, you can use a Snowflake Data Clean Room to collaborate. The
provider who is sharing their data in a clean room defines what analyses can be run against the shared data, which allows the consumer to
gather insights from the data without having unrestricted access to it.

For more information, see [Overview of Snowflake Data Clean Rooms](/user-guide/cleanrooms/overview).
