# SQL class reference

These topics provide reference information for Snowflake [classes](/sql-reference/snowflake-db-classes).

Each class supports one or more of the following SQL operations:

- ALTER: Modifies the properties of an instance of a class.
- CREATE: Creates an instance of a class.
- DROP: Deletes an instance of a class.
- SHOW: Lists instances of a class.

An instance of a class can have one or more methods. A method is a stored procedure or function and can be called by
using the instance name and method name, and arguments (if any) required by the method. For example,
`CALL instance_name!method_name(...)`.

## Updating your search path

You can add the schema for classes you use frequently to your search path to save typing and make your SQL statements
more concise. For more information about updating your search path, see [Update your search path](/sql-reference/snowflake-db-classes#label-update-search-path).
