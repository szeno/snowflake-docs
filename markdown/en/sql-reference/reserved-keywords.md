# Reserved & limited keywords

Snowflake SQL reserves all ANSI keywords (with the exception of type keywords such as CHAR, DATE, DECIMAL, etc.), as well as some additional keywords (ASC, DESC, MINUS, etc.) that are reserved by
other popular databases. Additionally, Snowflake reserves keywords REGEXP and RLIKE (which function like the ANSI reserved keyword LIKE) and SOME (which is a synonym for the ANSI reserved keyword ANY).

To avoid parsing ambiguities, Snowflake SQL also prohibits the use of keywords such as LEFT, OUTER, JOIN, etc. as table names or aliases in the FROM list, and the use of keywords such as TRUE, FALSE, CASE,
etc. as column references in scalar expressions.

The following table provides the list of reserved keywords in Snowflake and keywords that are not strictly reserved, but have usage limitations:
