# SYSTEM$BLOCK\_INTERNAL\_STAGES\_PUBLIC\_ACCESS

[Business Critical Feature](/user-guide/intro-editions)

This function requires Business Critical (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).

Prevents all public traffic from accessing the internal stage of the current Snowflake account on Microsoft Azure.

This function uses settings for the internal stage’s Azure storage account to block public IP addresses. For details on which Azure settings
are affected, refer to [Blocking public access — \*Recommended\*](/user-guide/private-internal-stages-azure#label-private-internal-stage-azure-block-public).

Important

Confirm that traffic via private connectivity is successfully reaching the internal stage before blocking public access. Blocking
public access without configuring private connectivity can cause unintended disruptions, including interference with managed services like
Azure Data Factory.
