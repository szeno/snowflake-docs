# SYSTEM$CLUSTERING\_INFORMATION

Returns clustering information, including average clustering depth and Automatic Clustering version, for a table based on one or more columns in the table.

See also:
:   [SYSTEM$CLUSTERING\_DEPTH](/sql-reference/functions/system_clustering_depth)

    [Automatic Clustering](/user-guide/tables-auto-reclustering)

## Syntax

Copy code

```
SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION( '<table_name>'
    [ , { '( <expr1> [ , <expr2> ... ] )' | <number_of_errors> } ] )
```

## Arguments

`table_name`
:   Table for which you want to return clustering information.

`(expr1 [ , expr2 ... ])`
:   Column names or expressions for which clustering information is returned:

    - For a table with no clustering key, this argument is required. If this argument is omitted, an error is returned.
    - For a table with a clustering key, this argument is optional; if the argument is omitted, Snowflake uses the defined clustering key to return clustering information.

    Even if only one column name or expression is passed, it must be inside parentheses.

    Note

    You can use this argument to return clustering information for any columns in the table, regardless of whether a clustering key is defined for the table.

    In other words, you can use this to help you decide what clustering to use in the future.

`number_of_errors`
:   Number of clustering errors returned by the function. If this argument is omitted, the 10 most recent errors are returned.

## Usage notes

- The second argument of the function specifies a column name/expression or a number of errors. You cannot include both arguments
  in a single function call.
- The table name, column name, and expression are strings, and should be enclosed in single quotes.
- For tables that use Optima Clustering, the following fields aren’t available:

  - `total_constant_partition_count`
  - `partition_depth_histogram`

  For more information about Optima Clustering, see [Optima Clustering](/user-guide/tables-auto-reclustering#label-optima-clustering).

## Returns

The function returns a value of type VARCHAR.

The returned string is in JSON format and contains the following name/value pairs:

`cluster_by_keys`
:   Columns in table used to return clustering information; can be any columns in the table.

`version`
:   Version of Automatic Clustering for the table:

    - `CLASSIC`: Clustering Classic
    - `OPTIMA`: Optima Clustering

    For more information, see [Optima Clustering](/user-guide/tables-auto-reclustering#label-optima-clustering).

`notes`
:   This column can contain suggestions to make clustering more efficient. For example, this field might contain a warning
    if the cardinality of the clustering column is extremely high.

    This column can be empty.

    For more information about how to cluster efficiently, see [Strategies for Selecting Clustering Keys](/user-guide/tables-clustering-keys#label-clustering-keys-strategies).

`total_partition_count`
:   Total number of micro-partitions that comprise the table.

`total_constant_partition_count`
:   Total number of micro-partitions for which the values of the specified columns have reached a constant state (i.e. the micro-partitions will not benefit significantly from reclustering). The number
    of constant micro-partitions in a table has an impact on pruning for queries. The higher the number, the more micro-partitions can be pruned from queries executed on the table, which has a
    corresponding impact on performance.

    This field isn’t available for tables that use Optima Clustering.

`average_overlaps`
:   Average number of overlapping micro-partitions for each micro-partition in the table. A high number indicates the table is not well-clustered.

`average_depth`
:   Average overlap depth of each micro-partition in the table. A high number indicates the table is not well-clustered.

    This value is also returned by [SYSTEM$CLUSTERING\_DEPTH](/sql-reference/functions/system_clustering_depth).

`partition_depth_histogram`
:   A histogram depicting the distribution of overlap depth for each micro-partition in the table. The histogram contains buckets with widths:

    - `0` to `16` with increments of `1`.
    - For buckets larger than `16`, increments of twice the width of the previous bucket (e.g. `32`, `64`, `128`, …).

    This field isn’t available for tables that use Optima Clustering.

`clustering_errors`
:   An array of JSON objects, each with a `timestamp` and `error` name/value pair. The `error` describes why automatic
    clustering was not able to recluster data.

    By default, the 10 most recent errors are returned in the array. To return more or fewer errors, specify a number as the second argument
    of the function.

For more information about micro-partition overlap and depth, and their impact on query pruning, see [Understanding Snowflake Table Structures](/user-guide/tables-micro-partitions).

## Examples

Return the 5 most recent clustering errors:

Return the clustering information for a table using two columns in the table:

> This example indicates that the `test2` table is not well-clustered for the following reasons:

> - Zero (`0`) constant micro-partitions out of `1156` total micro-partitions.

## Limitations

If a table has more than 2 million partitions:

- The results of the function are based on a subset of the table’s partitions.
- The value of the output’s `total_partition_count` field is 2 million.
