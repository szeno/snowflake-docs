# PNDSPY1031

**Message** Pandas < **pandas.core.frame.DataFrame.**dataframe**** > has a partial mapping with a few scenarios not supported in Snowpark.

**Category** Warning

## Description

This issue appears when the SMA detects the use of a pandas element that has a direct equivalent in Snowpark pandas, but some scenarios might behave differently than pandas.

**Reason:** N for columns of type Timedelta and columns containing list objects.

## Scenario

A method with a few scenarios that aren’t supported in Snowpark.

### Input

The following example shows a method with a few unsupported scenarios in Snowpark.

Copy code

```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
result = pd.__dataframe__(df)
```

### Output

The SMA adds the EWI `PNDSPY1031` to the output code to let you know that this element has a few scenarios that aren’t supported in Snowpark.

Copy code

```
import snowflake.snowpark.modin.pandas as pd

#EWI: PNDSPY1031 => pandas.core.frame.DataFrame.__dataframe__ has a partial mapping, with few scenarios not supported. Check Snowpark pandas documentation for more detail.
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
result = pd.__dataframe__(df)
```

## Recommended fix

**Data type consideration**: N for columns of type Timedelta and columns containing list objects.

Ensure data types are compatible:

- Check column dtypes with `df.dtypes` before the operation
- Use `.astype()` to convert columns to expected types
- Numeric operations may require explicit casting: `df['col'].astype(float)`

## Additional recommendations

Check the [Snowpark pandas documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/modin/supported/index) to verify which scenarios aren’t supported for that specific element.
